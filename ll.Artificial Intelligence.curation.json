In the present study, the methodology of tensor subspace analysis (TSA) is used to reduce the initial high-dimensionality of the pairwise coupling in the original functional connectivity network to a space of condensed descriptive power, which would significantly decrease the computational cost and facilitate the differentiation of brain states.

Materials and Methods An AI system was developed by using 470 388 fully anonymized institutional adult chest radiographs acquired from 2007 to 2017. The free-text radiology reports were preprocessed by using an in-house natural language processing (NLP) system modeling radiologic language. The NLP system analyzed the free-text report to prioritize each radiograph as critical, urgent, nonurgent, or normal. An AI system for computer vision using an ensemble of two deep CNNs was then trained by using labeled radiographs to predict the clinical priority from radiologic appearances only. The system's performance in radiograph prioritization was tested in a simulation by using an independent set of 15 887 radiographs. Prediction performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also determined. Nonparametric testing of the improvement in time to final report was determined at a nominal significance level of 5%. Results Normal chest radiographs were detected by our AI system with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, PPV of 73%, and NPV of 94%. The average reporting delay was reduced from 11.2 to 2.7 days for critical imaging findings (P < .001) and from 7.6 to 4.1 days for urgent imaging findings (P < .001) in the simulation compared with historical data.

It is comprised of a comfortable sensorized t-shirt that can acquire the inter-beat interval time series, the heart rate, and the respiratory dynamics for long-term monitoring during the day and overnight. In this study, three bipolar patients were followed for a period of 90 days during which up to six monitoring sessions and psychophysical evaluations were performed for each patient.

We illustrate this approach using two case studies with publicly available gene expression data sets: one involving a SAGE data of breast cancer patients and the other involving a time course cDNA microarray data on yeast. Six well known clustering algorithms UPGMA, K-Means, Diana, Fanny, Model-Based and SOM were evaluated.CONCLUSION: No single clustering algorithm may be best suited for clustering genes into functional groups via expression profiles for all data sets.

The proposed controller has the objective of ensuring a given degree of sterilization during Heating (by providing a minimum temperature inside the cans during a given time) and then a smooth Cooling, avoiding sudden pressure variations.

As dynamical models of this kind of processes are too complex and involve many uncertainties, controllers based on learning are proposed. Thus, based on the control objectives and the constraints on input and output variables, the proposed controllers learn the most adequate control actions by looking up a certain matrix that contains the state-action mapping, starting from a preselected state-action space.

However, the bulk of this research has been conducted in the context of social support interventions that specifically address stressful situations or health improvements. Little research has examined social support received from artificial agents in everyday contexts.OBJECTIVE: Considering that social support manifests in not only crises but also everyday situations and that everyday social support forms the basis of support received during more stressful events, we aimed to investigate the types of everyday social support that can be received from artificial agents.METHODS: In Study 1, we examined publicly available user reviews (N=1854) of Replika, a popular companion chatbot. In Study 2, a sample (n=66) of Replika users provided detailed open-ended responses regarding their experiences of using Replika. We conducted thematic analysis on both datasets to gain insight into the kind of everyday social support that users receive through interactions with Replika.RESULTS: Replika provides some level of companionship that can help curtail loneliness, provide a \"safe space\" in which users can discuss any topic without the fear of judgment or retaliation, increase positive affect through uplifting and nurturing messages, and provide helpful information/advice when normal sources of informational support are not available.CONCLUSIONS: Artificial agents may be a promising source of everyday social support, particularly companionship, emotional, informational, and appraisal support, but not as tangible support.

In the case of the finite-strain (FS) reorientation strategy, we borrow results from the pose estimation literature in computer vision to derive an analytical gradient of the registration objective function. By utilizing the closed-form gradient and the velocity field representation of one parameter subgroups of diffeomorphisms, the resulting registration algorithm is diffeomorphic and fast.

Second, since the object's motion is linear and intrinsically different from the Gaussian-like turbulence, a Gaussian-based turbulence model can be employed to enforce an additional constraint on the search space of the minimization.

Atrial activity was extracted by three algorithms, Spatiotemporal QRST cancellation (STC), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA).

It has previously been reported that around 13% of sentences found in biomedical research articles contain negation. Historically, the main motivation for identifying negated events has been to ensure their exclusion from lists of extracted interactions. However, recently, there has been a growing interest in negative results, which has resulted in negation detection being identified as a key challenge in biomedical relation extraction. In this article, we focus on the problem of identifying negated bio-events, given gold standard event annotations.RESULTS: We have conducted a detailed analysis of three open access bio-event corpora containing negation information (i.e., GENIA Event, BioInfer and BioNLP'09 ST), and have identified the main types of negated bio-events. We have analysed the key aspects of a machine learning solution to the problem of detecting negated events, including selection of negation cues, feature engineering and the choice of learning algorithm. Combining the best solutions for each aspect of the problem, we propose a novel framework for the identification of negated bio-events. We have evaluated our system on each of the three open access corpora mentioned above. The performance of the system significantly surpasses the best results previously reported on the BioNLP'09 ST corpus, and achieves even better results on the GENIA Event and BioInfer corpora, both of which contain more varied and complex events.CONCLUSIONS: Recently, in the field of biomedical text mining, the development and enhancement of event-based systems has received significant interest. The ability to identify negated events is a key performance element for these systems. We have conducted the first detailed study on the analysis and identification of negated bio-events. Our proposed framework can be integrated with state-of-the-art event extraction systems. The resulting systems will be able to extract bio-events with attached polarities from textual documents, which can serve as the foundation for more elaborate systems that are able to detect mutually contradicting bio-events.", "pmid": "23323936", "title": "Negated bio-events: analysis and identification."}, {"journal": "Studies in health technology and informatics", "meshMajor": ["Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence", "Humans", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Odorants", "Smell", "Software"], "year": "2000", "abstractText": "For practical applications, artificial neural networks have to meet several requirements: Mainly they should learn quick, classify accurate and behave robust.

Positioned in a fixed-wing aircraft in a downward-looking mode, the spectrometer is used to detect ground sources of ethanol vapor from an altitude of 2000-3000 ft. Challenges to the use of this approach for the routine detection of chemical plumes include (1) the presence of a constantly changing background radiance as the aircraft flies, (2) the cost and complexity of collecting the data needed to train the classification algorithms used in implementing the plume detection, and (3) the need for rapid interferogram scans to minimize the ground area viewed per scan. To address these challenges, this work couples a novel ground-based data collection and training protocol with the use of signal processing and pattern recognition methods based on short sections of the interferogram data collected by the spectrometer. In the data collection, heated plumes of ethanol vapor are released from a portable emission stack and viewed by the spectrometer from ground level against a synthetic background designed to simulate a terrestrial radiance source. Classifiers trained with these data are subsequently tested with airborne data collected over a period of 2.5 years. Two classifier architectures are compared in this work: support vector machines (SVM) and piecewise linear discriminant analysis (PLDA).

The algorithm works in real time and requires no prior knowledge of target or barrier movements. In the case that the barriers are stationary, this paper proves that this algorithm always results in the robot catching the target, provided it moves at a greater speed than the target, and the dynamic-system update frequency is sufficiently large. Like most robot-path-planning approaches, the environment is represented by a topologically organized map. Each grid point on the map has only local connections to its neighboring grid points from which it receives information in real time. The information stored at each point is a current estimate of the distance to the nearest target and the neighbor from which this distance was determined. Updating the distance estimate at each grid point is done using only the information gathered from the point's neighbors, that is, each point can be considered an independent processor, and the order in which grid points are updated is not determined based on global knowledge of the current distances at each point or the previous history of each point. The robot path is determined in real time completely from the information at the robot's current grid-point location. The computational effort to update each point is minimal, allowing for rapid propagation of the distance information outward along the grid from the target locations. In the static situation, where both the targets and the barriers do not move, this algorithm is a DP solution to the shortest path problem, but is restricted by lack of global knowledge. In this case, this paper proves that the dynamic system converges in a small number of iterations to a state where the minimal distance to a target is recorded at each grid point and shows that this robot-path-planning algorithm can be made to always choose an optimal path. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated through a number of simulations.", "pmid": "16903362", "title": "An efficient dynamic system for real-time robot-path planning."}, {"journal": "IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence", "meshMajor": ["Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence", "Bayes Theorem", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Information Storage and Retrieval", "Models, Statistical", "Pattern Recognition, Automated"], "year": "2006", "abstractText": "In this paper, the optimizations of three fundamental components of image understanding: segmentation/annotation, 3D sensing (stereo) and 3D fitting, are posed and integrated within a Bayesian framework.

Bands containing the LH2 and reaction center (RC)-LH1 complexes were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectroscopy (MS)/MS. The results revealed that the LH2 band contained distinct levels of the LH2-\u00e1 and -\u00e2 polypeptides encoded by the two puc operons. Polypeptide subunits encoded by the puc2AB operon predominated under high light and in the early stages of acclimation to low light, while after 24\u00a0h, the puc1BAC components were most abundant. Surprisingly, the Puc2A polypeptide containing a 251 residue C-terminal extension not present in Puc1A, was a protein of major abundance. A predominance of Puc2A components in the LH2 complex formed at high light intensity is followed by a >2.5-fold enrichment in Puc1B levels between 3 and 24\u00a0h of acclimation, accompanied by a nearly twofold decrease in Puc2A levels.

Macroautophagy/autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that maintains cell balance in response to stress-related stimulation. Abnormal autophagy occurs with many pathologies, such as cancer, and autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, clarification of the mechanisms of autophagy regulation is of utmost importance. Recently, researchers presented microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel and potent modulators of autophagic activity. Here, we found that Mir223 deficiency significantly ameliorated CNS inflammation, demyelination and the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and increased resting microglia and autophagy in brain microglial cells. In contrast, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methylademine (3-MA) aggravated the clinical symptoms of EAE in wild-type (WT) and Mir223-deficienct mice. Furthermore, it was confirmed that Mir223 deficiency in mice increased the protein expression of ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16-like 1 [S. cerevisiae]) and LC3-II in bone marrow-derived macrophage cells compared with cells from WT mice. Indeed, the cellular level of Atg16l1 was decreased in BV2 cells upon Mir223 overexpression and increased following the introduction of antagomirs. We also showed that the 3' UTR of Atg16l1 contained functional Mir223-responsive sequences and that overexpression of ATG16L1 returned autophagy to normal levels even in the presence of Mir223 mimics. Collectively, these data indicate that Mir223 is a novel and important regulator of autophagy and that Atg16l1 is a Mir223 target in this process, which may have implications for improving our understanding of the neuroinflammatory process of EAE.

Although clinicians have noted the importance of atypical head positioning (e.g. social peering and repetitive head banging) when diagnosing children with ASD, a quantitative understanding of head movement in ASD is lacking. Here, we conduct a quantitative comparison of head movement dynamics in children with and without ASD using automated, person-independent computer-vision\u00a0based head tracking (Zface). Because children with ASD often exhibit preferential attention to nonsocial versus social stimuli, we investigated whether children with and without ASD differed in their head movement dynamics depending on stimulus sociality.Methods: The current study examined differences in head movement dynamics in children with (n\u2009=\u200921) and without ASD (n\u2009=\u200921). Children were video-recorded while watching a 16-min video of social and nonsocial stimuli. Three dimensions of rigid head movement-pitch (head nods), yaw (head turns), and roll (lateral head inclinations)-were tracked using Zface. The root mean square of pitch, yaw, and roll was calculated to index the magnitude of head angular displacement (quantity of head movement) and angular velocity (speed).Results: Compared with children without ASD, children with ASD exhibited greater yaw displacement, indicating greater head turning, and greater velocity of yaw and roll, indicating faster head turning and inclination. Follow-up analyses indicated that differences in head movement dynamics were specific to the social rather than the nonsocial stimulus condition.Conclusions: Head movement dynamics (displacement and velocity) were greater in children with ASD than in\u00a0children without ASD, providing a quantitative foundation for previous clinical reports. Head movement differences were evident in lateral (yaw and roll) but not vertical (pitch) movement and were specific to a social rather than nonsocial condition.

This situation is fueled by a complex array of factors, mainly the consequences of the political and military turmoil of the Arab Spring.

We used a maximum variation, purposive sampling strategy to recruit male and female participants, aged 14-18 years, from schools, prisons, and community-based informal re-education and rehabilitation centers in Tripoli, Libya.RESULTS: In total, 31 participants were recruited: 6 females and 25 males. Sixteen participants were prisoners and residents of community-based informal re-education and rehabilitation centers, and 15 were recruited in schools. Risk factors for drug use included peer influence, the increased availability and affordability of drugs, disruption of social life and healthy recreational activities, and the distress and casualties of the war. Protective factors were religious beliefs and practices, good parent-child connectedness, and high self-esteem and future aspiration. Risk factors for HIV were insufficient knowledge related to HIV transmission and unsafe injection practices, such as sharing needles and syringes.CONCLUSION: We found individual, interpersonal, family, and structural-level factors that interplayed to shape the vulnerability of young people to drug use and HIV infection in Tripoli, Libya. Structural factors, including the increased availability and affordability of drugs, provided the frame within which other factors, such as peer influence, insufficient knowledge of substance use, and HIV, operated to increase the vulnerability of young people to drugs and HIV, while religious beliefs and parent-child connectedness acted as protective factors.

For early-stage tumors, tumor size ?20\u00a0mm and a high NLR were independent risk factors for poor OS (hazard ratio (HR): 3.255, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.082-9.789, P\u00a0=\u00a00.036; HR: 3.690, 95% CI: 1.026-13.272, P\u00a0=\u00a00.046, respectively) and RFS (HR:\u00a03.575, 95% CI: 1.174-10.892, P\u00a0=\u00a00.025; HR: 5.380, 95% CI: 1.587-18.234, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007, respectively). The NLR was not correlated with prognosis in patients with advanced stages.CONCLUSIONS: An elevated preoperative NLR was an important prognosticator for early TNM stage PDAC.

Over the past several decades, a variety of rhinoplasty techniques have been described focusing on the classification of bony and cartilaginous deviation. Nevertheless, corrective rhinoplasty is still a challenging procedure even for experienced surgeons because of the high recurrence rate of deviation. In attempt to reduce the recurrence rate, the author systematized the complex procedures by using a single technique regardless of the classification of a deviation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients who underwent corrective rhinoplasty between June 2009 and December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. All the patients were operated using 4 main surgical procedures: anterior approach septal correction, unilateral osteotomy, and medialization of the deviated complex to the contralateral intact side, and dorsal augmentation with a dermofat graft. Assessment of improvement was based on photo standardization. The degree of nasal deviation, nasofrontal angle, tip projection-to-nasal length ratio, vertical line of the upper lip-to-tip projection ratio, and columellar-labial angle were measured.RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative anthropometric measurements revealed that the mean degree of deviation changed from 10.19\u00b0 to 3.43\u00b0 (P < 0.01), and the degree of nasofrontal angle changed from 131.55\u00b0 to 133.14\u00b0 (P < 0.01).

Modifications of tRNA at nucleoside 37, 3'-adjacent to the anticodon, are particularly interesting because they facilitate codon recognition and negate translational frame-shifting.

The ASL structures had similarly resolved stems (RMSD approximately 0.6A) of five canonical base-pairs in standard A-form RNA. The \"NOE walk\" was evident on the 5' and 3' sides of the stems of both RNAs, and extended to the adjacent loop nucleosides. The NOESY cross-peaks involving U(33) H2' and characteristic of tRNA's anticodon domain U-turn were present but weak, whereas those involving the U(33) H1' proton were absent from the spectra of both ASLs.

Somatostatin did not decrease basal prolactin secretion in the control cells, but it caused a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin release from the estrogen pretreated cells. Estrogen pretreatment did not alter the sensitivity of pituitary cells to dopamine; dopamine was equally effective in the control and estrogen pretreated pituitaries in decreasing the basal prolactin secretion and TRH induced prolactin release. Prolactin release from the estrogen pretreated cells, stimulated by 25 nM TRH was inhibited by 1 nM somatostatin and nearly totally abolished by 25 nM somatostatin, whereas in the control cells only the higher dose of somatostatin caused some decrease in the prolactin release. Estrogen pretreated cells showed a reduced response to GHRH. Somatostatin did not decrease the basal secretion of GH in either group, but at 1 nM dose it completely abolished the GH release induced by equimolar concentration of GHRH. However, after somatostatin was eliminated from the system, a delayed GH release could be observed that was greater in the control pituitaries than in the estrogen pretreated pituitaries. It is concluded that in vivo treatment with estrogen reduces GH secretion in response to GHRH and increases prolactin secretion after TRH stimulation. After estrogen treatment, the basal and TRH stimulated prolactin release can be effectively reduced by somatostatin.

Data were obtained and then analyzed. LTS was stratified by (1) subglottic or tracheal stenosis and (2) multilevel stenosis (MLS; glottic and subglottic/tracheal). Pre- and postoperative V-RQOL and grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain (GRBAS) scores were compared. The number and frequency of balloon dilation procedures over the lifetime were secondary outcome variables.RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were identified: 26 subglottic/tracheal and 12 multilevel. Of these, 71.4% required multiple dilations, with greatest dilations/patient for multilevel stenosis (4.8). V-RQOL improved in the 27 patients with completed pre- and postoperative scores from a mean of 70.4 to 80 (P=.025). Pre/postoperative V-RQOLs for tracheal/subglottic (mean, 82.8/93.8) were significantly higher (P=.0001/.0001) than multilevel stenosis (48/55.3).

To evaluate unilateral PBF, 20 patients with various congenital heart diseases undergoing cineangiography and lung perfusion scintigraphy were studied. The diameter of PA was measured immediately proximal to the origin of the first lobar branches bilaterally, and right PA area, left PA area, PA area (mm2), and PA index (mm2/m2) were calculated. The diameter of PV was also measured distal to the junction with the left atrium. Right PV area, left PV area, PV area (mm2), and PV index (mm2/m2) were calculated from these diameters. Pulmonary blood flow (PBF) was obtained by the Fick method during catheterization. To evaluate unilateral PBF, PBF was divided into right and left PBF according to the right/left perfusion ratio measured by lung perfusion scintigraphy.RESULTS: Evaluation of bilateral PBF was as follows: in normal patients, PA and PV areas were correlated with body surface area (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001 and r = 0.93, p = 0.0001); PA index and PV index ranged from 248 to 436 (mean = 343) mm2/m2 and from 346 to 595 (mean = 466) mm2/m2, respectively, and were constant irrespective of body surface area; PA and PV areas were correlated with PBF in normal patients, as well as in patients with tetralogy of Fallot. There was a better correlation between PV area and PBF than between PA area and PBF in normal patients, as well as a significantly better correlation in patients with tetralogy of Fallot.

Knowledge from molecular genetic studies could help to devise strategies in alleviating this problem; however, few peanut DNA sequences are available in the public database. In order to understand the molecular basis of host resistance to aflatoxin contamination, a large-scale project was conducted to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from developing seeds to identify resistance-related genes involved in defense response against Aspergillus infection and subsequent aflatoxin contamination.RESULTS: We constructed six different cDNA libraries derived from developing peanut seeds at three reproduction stages (R5, R6 and R7) from a resistant and a susceptible cultivated peanut genotypes, 'Tifrunner' (susceptible to Aspergillus infection with higher aflatoxin contamination and resistant to TSWV) and 'GT-C20' (resistant to Aspergillus with reduced aflatoxin contamination and susceptible to TSWV). The developing peanut seed tissues were challenged by A. parasiticus and drought stress in the field. A total of 24,192 randomly selected cDNA clones from six libraries were sequenced. After removing vector sequences and quality trimming, 21,777 high-quality EST sequences were generated. Sequence clustering and assembling resulted in 8,689 unique EST sequences with 1,741 tentative consensus EST sequences (TCs) and 6,948 singleton ESTs. Functional classification was performed according to MIPS functional catalogue criteria. The unique EST sequences were divided into twenty-two categories. A similarity search against the non-redundant protein database available from NCBI indicated that 84.78% of total ESTs showed significant similarity to known proteins, of which 165 genes had been previously reported in peanuts. There were differences in overall expression patterns in different libraries and genotypes. A number of sequences were expressed throughout all of the libraries, representing constitutive expressed sequences. In order to identify resistance-related genes with significantly differential expression, a statistical analysis to estimate the relative abundance (R) was used to compare the relative abundance of each gene transcripts in each cDNA library. Thirty six and forty seven unique EST sequences with threshold of R > 4 from libraries of 'GT-C20' and 'Tifrunner', respectively, were selected for examination of temporal gene expression patterns according to EST frequencies. Nine and eight resistance-related genes with significant up-regulation were obtained in 'GT-C20' and 'Tifrunner' libraries, respectively. Among them, three genes were common in both genotypes. Furthermore, a comparison of our EST sequences with other plant sequences in the TIGR Gene Indices libraries showed that the percentage of peanut EST matched to Arabidopsis thaliana, maize (Zea mays), Medicago truncatula, rapeseed (Brassica napus), rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) ESTs ranged from 33.84% to 79.46% with the sequence identity >/= 80%. These results revealed that peanut ESTs are more closely related to legume species than to cereal crops, and more homologous to dicot than to monocot plant species.CONCLUSION: The developed ESTs can be used to discover novel sequences or genes, to identify resistance-related genes and to detect the differences among alleles or markers between these resistant and susceptible peanut genotypes. Additionally, this large collection of cultivated peanut EST sequences will make it possible to construct microarrays for gene expression studies and for further characterization of host resistance mechanisms. It will be a valuable genomic resource for the peanut community.

To determine which miRNAs were changed in expression, miRNA arrays were performed on heart tissue from HCM patients with a MYBPC3 mutation (n=6) and compared with hearts of non-failing donors (n=6). 532 out of 664 analyzed miRNAs were expressed in at least one heart sample. 13 miRNAs were differentially expressed in HCM compared with donors (at p<0.01, fold change ? 2). The genomic context of these differentially expressed miRNAs revealed that miR-204 (fold change 2.4 in HCM vs. donor) was located in an intron of the TRPM3 gene, encoding an aspecific cation channel involved in calcium entry. RT-PCR analysis revealed a trend towards TRPM3 upregulation in HCM compared with donor myocardium (fold change 2.3, p=0.078). In silico identification of mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs showed a large proportion of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor signaling and we showed reduced phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I in the HCM myocardium when compared with donor.

Air was sampled as particulate matter (PM) greater than 10\u00a0\u00ecm (PM\u00a0>\u00a010) and PM between 2.5 and 10\u00a0\u00ecm.

In Munich 70% of annual exposure was detected between June 12th and August 28th. Multivariate modeling showed that endotoxin levels could be explained by phenological parameters (ie, plant growth). Indeed, days with high airborne endotoxin levels correlated well with the amount of Artemisia pollen in the air. Pollen collected from plants across Europe (100 locations) showed that the highest levels of endotoxin were detected on Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) pollen, with little on other pollen. Microbiome analysis showed that LPS concentrations on mugwort pollen were related to the presence of Pseudomonas species and Pantoea species communities.

S1P can regulate airway smooth muscle functions associated with asthmatic inflammation and remodeling, including cytokine secretion. To date however, whether S1P induces secretion of an important chemokine responsible for neutrophilia in airway inflammation--IL-8--was unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate whether S1P induces IL-8 gene expression and secretion to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro, as well as examine the molecular mechanisms responsible for repression by the corticosteroid dexamethasone. We show that S1P upregulates IL-8 secretion from ASM cells and enhance neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro. The corticosteroid dexamethasone significantly represses IL-8 mRNA expression and protein secretion in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, we reveal that S1P-induced IL-8 secretion is p38 MAPK and ERK-dependent and that these key phosphoproteins act on the downstream effector mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) to control secretion of the neutrophil chemoattractant cytokine IL-8. The functional relevance of this in vitro data was demonstrated by neutrophil chemotaxis assays where S1P-induced effects can be significantly attenuated by pretreatment with dexamethasone, pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK- or ERK-mediated pathways, or by knocking down MSK-1 with siRNA.

A better understanding of its behavior, in either normal or diseased conditions, goes through an increased knowledge of basic mechanisms involved in neuronal function, including at the single-cell level. This has motivated significant efforts for the development of miniaturized sensing devices to monitor neuronal activity with high spatial and signal resolution. One of the main challenges remaining to be addressed in this domain is, however, the ability to create in vitro spatially ordered neuronal networks at low density with a precise control of the cell location to ensure proper monitoring of the activity of a defined set of neurons. Here, we present a novel self-aligned chemical functionalization method, based on a repellant surface with patterned attractive areas, which permits the elaboration of low-density neuronal network down to individual cells with a high control of the soma location and axonal growth. This approach is compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor line technology at a wafer scale and allows performing the cell culture on packaged chip outside microelectronics facilities. Rat cortical neurons were cultured on such patterned surfaces for over one month and displayed a very high degree of organization in large networks. Indeed, more than 90% of the network nodes were settled by a soma and 100% of the connecting lines were occupied by a neurite, with a very good selectivity (low parasitic cell connections). After optimization, networks composed of 75% of unicellular nodes were obtained, together with a control at the micron scale of the location of the somas. Finally, we demonstrated that the dendritic neuronal growth was guided by the surface functionalization, even when micrometer scale topologies were encountered and we succeeded to control the extension growth along one-dimensional-aligned nanostructures with sub-micrometrical scale precision.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of pediatric liver disease in western countries. Its prevalence in Indian subcontinent is not well studied.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a school based cross sectional study we have screened overweight and obese children in the age group of 11 to 15 years for NAFLD. Ultrasonography, elevated serum transaminases, fibroscan were used for defining NAFLD. Dietary habits, blood pressure, serum lipid profile, blood counts and insulin resistance were recorded. The relation of fibrosis 4 score, pediatric NAFLD fibrosis index, aspartate transaminases to platelet ratio index (APRI) with fibroscan was evaluated.RESULTS: Out of 616 students screened 198 were overweight and obese. Hundred students and their parents gave informed consent for the further evaluation. The prevalence of NAFLD was 62% in overweight and obese children. Fatty liver was found in 50 % students on ultrasonography, liver stiffness (? 6.1 Kilopascals) in 23% and raised alanine transaminase in 30%. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance were seen in 6%, 18%, 2% and 66% students respectively. Systolic hypertension, serum triglyceride, aspartate transaminase, APRI was significantly higher in the NAFLD group. On binary logistic regression only systolic hypertension was an independent risk factor for NAFLD.CONCLUSION: In conclusion NAFLD is common in asymptomatic overweight and obese Indian children. Systolic hypertension is the only independent factor associated with NAFLD. Fibroscan has limited role for screening.

Youths who engaged in overeating were more likely to be overweight or obese, to have dieted in the past year, to be trying to lose weight currently, and to report that weight and shape are very important to their overall feelings about self. Youths who met criteria for binge eating syndrome (high frequency of objective overeating with loss of control and distress regarding the binge eating) scored significantly lower on measures of body satisfaction and self-esteem and higher on a measure of depressive mood than those who reported either subclinical or no binge eating. Overeating was associated with suicide risk; more than one fourth of girls (28.6%) and boys (27.8%) who met criteria for binge eating syndrome reported that they had attempted suicide.CONCLUSIONS: Overeating among adolescents is associated with a number of adverse behaviors and negative psychological experiences.

Physicians' and patients' adherence to follow-up guidelines permits postponing or reducing these complications. The objectives were to assess the level of adherence to fundamental follow-up guidelines and determine patients' characteristics associated with this level of adherence in the context of Luxembourg, where no guidelines were implemented.STUDY POPULATION: The exhaustive residing population treated for type 2 diabetes in Luxembourg during the 2000-2006 period (N = 21,068).METHODS: Seven fundamental criteria were extracted from international guidelines (consultation with the treating physician, HbA1c tests, electrocardiogram, retinal, dental, lipid and renal check-ups). The factors associated with the level of adherence to those criteria were identified using a partial proportional odds model.RESULTS: In 2006, despite 90% of the patients consulted at least 4 times their treating physician, only 0.6% completed all criteria; 55.0% had no HbA1c test (-8.6 points since 2000) and 31.1% had a renal check-up (+21.6 points).

In rodents, increased CREB activity within the NAc produces depression-like signs including anhedonia, whereas disruption of CREB activity by expression of a dominant-negative CREB (mCREB, which acts as a CREB antagonist) has antidepressant-like effects. We examined how disruption of CREB activity affects brain reward processes using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) and inducible bitransgenic mice with enriched expression of mCREB in forebrain regions including the NAc. Mutant mice or littermate controls were prepared with lateral hypothalamic stimulating electrodes, and trained in the ICSS procedure to determine the frequency at which the stimulation becomes rewarding (threshold). Inducible expression of mCREB did not affect baseline sensitivity to brain stimulation itself. However, mCREB-expressing mice were more sensitive to the rewarding (threshold-lowering) effects of cocaine. Interestingly, mCREB mice were insensitive to the depressive-like (threshold-elevating) effects of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U50,488. These behavioral differences were accompanied by decreased mRNA expression of G-protein receptor kinase-3 (GRK3), a protein involved in opioid receptor desensitization, within the NAc of mCREB mice. Disruption of CREB or GRK3 activity within the NAc specifically by viral-mediated gene transfer enhanced the rewarding impact of brain stimulation in rats, establishing the contribution of functional changes within this region. Together with previous findings, these studies raise the possibility that disruption of CREB in the NAc influences motivation by simultaneously facilitating reward and reducing depressive-like states such as anhedonia and dysphoria.", "pmid": "19211892", "title": "Altered sensitivity to rewarding and aversive drugs in mice with inducible disruption of cAMP response element-binding protein function within the nucleus accumbens."}, {"journal": "Tree physiology", "meshMajor": ["Acclimatization", "Droughts", "Environment", "Ericaceae", "Forests", "Photosynthesis", "Pinus", "Plant Leaves", "Quercus", "Seasons", "Spain", "Species Specificity"], "year": "2015", "abstractText": "The Mediterranean region is a hot spot of climate change vulnerable to increased droughts and heat waves.

Structural analysis of hTop2\u00e1 and hTop2\u00e2 revealed the presence of methionine residues in the drug-binding pocket, we therefore tested whether a tighter Top2-drug association may be accomplished by introducing a methionine-reactive Pt2+ into a drug to further stabilize the DNA break.

Crystallographic analyses of hTop2\u00e2 complexed with DNA and etoplatin-N2\u00e2 demonstrate coordinate bond formation between Pt2+ and a flanking methionine.
