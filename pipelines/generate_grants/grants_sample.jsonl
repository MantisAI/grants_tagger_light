{"title":"Enhancing Intramuscular Fat Deposition in Meat-Producing Ruminant Animals","abstract":"Marbling or intramuscular fat deposition in beef is a major determinant of carcass quality and value in the US. According to the National Beef Quality Audits (NBQA; Lorenzen et al., 1993; McKenna et al., 2000; Garcia et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2012) marbling scores and quality grades have increased from 1993 to 2016. The percentage of carcasses grading Prime has increased by 64% and upper Choice (CAB) by 75%. The percentage of carcasses grading Select or Standard decreased by 35% and 86%, respectively. The Choice-Select spread can range from $2 to $25\/cwt depending on the time of year. Premiums for Certified Angus Beef (CAB; Upper Choice) range from $4 to $14\/cwt and for Prime range from $9-26\/cwt depending on time of year. These premiums can have a significant impact on value and profitability of beef cattle production systems. Retailers and restaurants want more Prime beef for their customers but only 2.1% of beef carcasses actually make the Prime grade (Moore et al., 2012). In order to deliver more Prime beef to the marketplace and increase beef value, beef producers must begin to utilize genetics at the cow-calf stage of production that promote intramuscular fat deposition and learn the best management practices for these cattle with genetic potential to reach their Prime quality grade target. Cow-calf producers cannot rely solely on the stocker\/feedlot phase to manage cattle to reach the Prime target. Marbling is a highly heritable trait (h = 0.48; American Angus Association, 2019), which means that genetic improvement can be made if selection pressure is applied. Cow-calf producing states like SC must work towards higher quality beef production by utilizing genetics with propensity to marble and determining the best calf management strategies in order to increase profitability and stay competitive in the marketplace.Meat animals rank 3rd and cattle and calves rank 6thin agricultural products sold in South Carolina (USDA-NASS, 2019).Cattle inventory as of January 1, 2020 was listed at 340,000 head (USDA-NASS, 2020). Forty-four percent of the 31.2 million beef cows in the U.S. are located in the 13 southeastern states (Beck et al., 2017). Cow numbers in the U.S. have decreased by about 35% from 1975 to 2015; however, total pounds of beef has remained the same with fewer numbers of cows due to increases in efficiency. With the projected world population increase to 9 billion by 2050, it is estimated that world beef production will need to increase by over 65% (FAO, 2012). This will not be easy since available agricultural land and agricultural producer numbers continue to decline; whereas average age of farmers continues to increase (Nosowitz, 2018). The efficiency of beef production must continue to improve in order to produce enough beef for the growing population to meet demands for quality for high quality grades, and to do so in a sustainable manner.","for_first_level_name":"Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences","mesh_terms":["Adipose Tissue","Animals","Body Composition","Breeding","Cattle","Female","Male","Meat","Red Meat","United States","United States Department of Agriculture"]}
{"title":"Advancing forest measurements with digital technology","abstract":"Forests provide critical ecosystem services but are impacted by intensified environmental challenges. Precision forest management and tree improvement efforts both require precise and detailed information. However, management decisions are often made using incomplete or qualitative data, hindering the ability to make truly informed, data-driven decisions that improve forest environmental and economic sustainability. Many conventional methods are not feasible over large areas (Hilkers et al. 2012), require considerable manual effort, thus incurring high costs (Estornell et al 2015, Xiao et al. 2005). In addition, they often rely on observations by trained experts, necessitating on-site inspection of individual trees, introducing substantial sources of error and reducing reproducibility of data collection efforts. Meanwhile, significant improvements have been made in digital technology and remote sensing that helped to lay the foundation for precision management. However, a critical technological gap remains in capturing key data and integrating multi-resolution, multi-stream and multi-platform data that can produce locally operationable information for precision management.

This bacterium is transmitted horizontally and vertically, making prevention and control difficult. Moreover, few FDA-approved treatment options exist, and US-vaccines are currently unavailable. Our recent USDA-funded research uncovered substantial US Fp diversity, revealed the predominating Fp strains causing outbreaks, and highlighted that Fp transmission from parents to offspring is behind many outbreaks, a concern given poor effectiveness of egg disinfection protocols. Our overarching goal is to arm aquaculturists with immediately deployable methods for reducing Fp-induced losses by halting parent-offspring transmission via: 1) Identifying predominating Fp serotypes associated with economic losses in US-aquaculture; 2) Developing a rapid assay for use \"pondside\" by farmers, thereby identifying Fp-free broodstock and eggs; 3) Optimizing a novel egg disinfection protocol that is effective against all US-predominating Fp variants; 4) Modeling generated findings and incorporating them into enhanced best management practices (BMP) to control BCWD; and 5) disseminating enhanced BMPs and training aquaculturists to perform \"pondside\" testing via workshops and webinars. This research will improve farmed trout\/salmon production in short-term by arming US aquaculturitsts with tools and training to prevent Fp egg-associated transmission.

{"title":"NSERC Industrial Research Chair for Colleges in Sustainable Aquaculture","abstract":"Resource-based industries such as forestry and fishing that were historically key economic drivers in coastal communities have in recent years seen considerable contraction and consequent job loss. As a result, the development of new industries in affected regions has become paramount. Key among these has been the emergence of salmon aquaculture, which is now a critical economic driver in many coastal areas across Canada. However, future environmental challenges may have consequences for the aquaculture industry. To address these challenges, it is extremely important for coastal communities to invest in environmental monitoring programs in order to understand precisely how these challenges will manifest and to promote sustainable farming practices. We propose here to implement innovative monitoring of environmental conditions, assess alternative farming site-restoration methods, and develop unique educational tools to increase opportunities for training and awareness. Specific innovative and novel concepts will include: 1) Development of an industry-driven, coast-wide environmental surveillance program with associated farm site system configuration, sampling data relay protocols, and database software that will comprise historical data as well as ongoing program inputs; 2) Development of a reliable benthic biomontoring tool, based on a Reference Condition Approach, that would represent a significant salmon production innovation, and arguably an improvement for current regulatory approach; 3) Commercial co-cultivation of kelp at marine salmon grow out sites, facilitating nutrient extraction at an industry scale, and provision of a kelp production model to assess\nenvironmental and socio-economic benefits of the opportunity; 4) Installation and operation of Educational Interface Technology that will facilitate learning and public awareness issues with coastal aquaculture.

{"title":"Gene expression in leukocytes after morphine treatment","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opioid treatment has been shown to cause generalized immunosuppression leading to an increased incidence of opportunistic disease and infection.

Identifying the intracellular pathways in immune cells involved in opioid-mediated immunosuppression is important for understanding the mechanisms responsible for increased disease susceptibility in HIV infection and addiction. To test the hypothesis that the immunosuppressive effects of morphine are mediated via dysregulation of genes in circulating leukocytes, the experiments proposed here will use a microarray to profile changes in gene expression and these results will be further verified using Taqman real-time PCR and western blotting. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) utilize a microarray gene expression profiling strategy to identify dysregulated genes within circulating blood leukocytes as potential mediators of morphine induced immunosuppression, 2) verify changes in gene expression using Taqman real-time PCR, 3) demonstrate changes in protein levels of dysregulated genes, 4) determine whether the dysregulation in genes is centrally or peripherally mediated.","for_first_level_name":"Biological Sciences","mesh_terms":["Gene Expression Profiling","Humans","Leukocytes","Morphine","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"]}
{"title":"Structure-function studies of lncRNAs involved in myogenesis","abstract":"Heart failure (HF) is a huge problem in the modern world ' only in the United States ~5.7 million adults have HF and 1 in 9 deaths in 2009 had HF as a contributing cause. HF not only destroys heart function, but it also leads to whole body changes. One of them is skeletal muscle wasting and impairment of their metabolism, structure and function. Skeletal muscles have a regeneration potential - the muscle stem cells offer the possibility of functional recovery or hypertrophy following injury or exercise. Moreover, C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts were used to sustain and potentially restore heart function after injury by forming differentiated grafts in mouse ventricular myocardium. In my studies I focus on a structure-function relation within MUNC, lncRNA upregulated specifically in skeletal muscles. In Aim 1 I will determine the secondary structure of mouse and human MUNC to ascertain their structural conservation and examine the effects of SNPs on RNA folding. Using SHAPE-MaP I will show the secondary structure of MUNC, sites protected by proteins and regions with well-defined structures. RNA Proximity Ligation assay will show pairwise interactions within RNA secondary structures. Next, SimRNA tool allows for RNA folding and 3D structure prediction. Based on data obtained in Aim 1, I will perform the experiments using various deletion constructs in C2C12 cells to determine functional domains of MUNC (Aim 2). I will measure the induction of specific genes during skeletal myogenesis by qRT-PCR and Western Blot, the differentiation efficiency by fusion index. Dual Luciferase\u00ae Reporter Assay will be used to check MUNC interaction with specific genomic sites and the repression of genes adjoining the interaction sites. As an additional goal, I would like also to conduct first studies in C2C12 cells on MT2953 lncRNA (upregulated in the heart and skeletal muscles) to determine whether it regulates skeletal myogenesis and plays a role in heart and skeletal muscle homeostasis. Those data will be perfect base for next lncRNA structure-function studies. The main goal of my studies is to show the importance of structure-function studies in the field of long noncoding RNAs. The information obtained within this study will show us which domains and structures in MUNC lncRNA are important for its role.

{"title":"GENETIC ANALYSES OF IDDM12 IN THE CTLA4\/CD28 REGION","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Investigator's abstract): Identification of the susceptibility genes is critical to elucidating the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and may provide new approaches to the development of novel intervention and prevention strategies. To date, genome-wide linkage analyses have suggested 14 promising IDDM susceptibility intervals. Whereas localization of these intervals is a major step forward, a difficult task remains in identifying the exact disease genes involved. The investigators have recently observed significant associations between IDDM and two polymorphic markers within the CTLA4 gene on chromosome 2q33 (p less than 10^-5) in a large multi-ethnic collection of diabetic families. These findings provide strong evidence for a least one IDDM susceptibility gene in the region surrounding CTLA4 (designate IDDM12). Analyses of additional markers flanking CTLA4 have narrowed IDDM12 to a region of less than 750kb. Within this interval, CTLA4, and its neighboring locus CS28, are the most likely candidate genes for IDDM12, not only because of their genomic locations but also their important roles in the regulation of T-cell activation. In this application, the investigators propose to continue their ongoing studies to identify IDDM12 using a combination of genetic and functional studies. Specific Aim 1 seeks to further define the genomic interval that contains IDDM12. The investigators propose to identify new polymorphic markers within the 750kb interval from YAC and BAC clones, and to test for their associations with IDDM in their diabetic pedigrees and case\/controls. These results will be used to establish a so-called association curve (a plot of strength of association against marker distance), which predicts the likely location of the disease gene. Specific Aim 2 seeks to investigate the potential involvement of CTLA4 and CD28 in IDDM pathogenesis through three sets of experiments. The first two seek the genetic basis for the involvement of the two molecules in IDDM through identification of mutations in the coding and regulatory regions of CTLA4 and CD28. The third will explore the functional importance of the CTLA4\/CD28 molecules in IDDM pathogenesis by comparing the expression levels of CTLA4, CD28, cytokines and other immunological parameters in normal controls, prediabetic and diabetic patients stratified by IDDM12 genotypes. Finally, if neither CTLA4 nor CD28 is IDDM12, the investigators will carry out positional cloning studies to identify the disease gene.","for_first_level_name":"Biological Sciences","mesh_terms":["Biomarkers","CD28 Antigens","CTLA-4 Antigen","Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Genotype","Humans","Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"]}
{"title":"The Role of the c-Myc-Egr1 Pathway in Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis and Ischemia","abstract":"While there is accumulating evidence that apoptosis contributes significantly to myocardial dysfunction following ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury, the pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in cardiomyocyte apoptosis remain unclear. c-Myc is dramatically upregulated following I\/R injury, but it is not known whether c-Myc is protective by promoting hypertrophy or detrimental by promoting apoptosis. In addition to c-Myc itself, specific c-Myc cofactors, such as ARF, Skp2 and nucleophosmin (NPM), have been predicted to have roles in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. We have recently described a novel p53-independent pathway, termed the Myc-ARF-Egr1 pathway. Direct binding of ARF to c-Myc is necessary for c-Myc to induce a noncanonical target gene, Egr1, which then mediates p53-independent c-Myc-induced apoptosis. We also show that ARF directly inhibits Skp2-mediated ubiquitylation of c-Myc, which is sufficient for Egr1 induction, thereby switching c-Myc from a proliferative protein to an apoptotic protein. In addition, we have reported that NPM directly interacts with c-Myc protein and promotes c-Myc-induced hyperproliferation, while NPM overexpression inhibits c-Myc-induced apoptosis by binding to and sequestering ARF. Preliminary studies also show that c-Myc overexpression leads to site-specific NPM phosphorylation. Although our preliminary studies show that all of these c-Myc cofactors and NPM phosphorylation are dramatically regulated during cardiomyocyte differentiation, there appears to be little change upon hypoxia, which is used to simulate ischemic conditions in culture. This proposal will further explore the regulation and role of the Myc-ARF-Egr1 and Myc-ARF-NPM network in different models of I\/R injury, in both mice and in cultured cardiomyocytes. Our hypothesis is that hypertrophy or apoptosis induced by overexpression of c-Myc following I\/R injury is dependent on interactions of ARF, Skp2 and NPM, which control the Myc-ARF-Egr1 apoptotic pathway and hypertrophy. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate the regulation and role of the Myc-ARF-Egr1 pathway and Myc-ARF-NPM network following I\/R injury in mice and simulated I\/R in cultured cardiomyocytes. Understanding these complex interactions will provide critical insights into the mechanism and function of c-Myc in cardiac injury and may be useful in developing specific approaches to control c-Myc-induced proliferation or apoptosis in I\/R injury.

Intermediate Filaments (IFs) are major components of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton in higher eukaryotes. In the public draft of the human genome, there are >67 functional genes encoding IF-forming polypeptides. These genes are regulated in a cell-specific manner and are highly conserved in mammalian genomes. A general function of IFs is to endow cells and tissues with mechanical resilience to withstand various types of physical and non-physical stresses. Defects in IF proteins underlie a vast number of genetically determined rare and common disorders involving epithelia (e.g., skin, oral, eye and liver disorders), muscle (e.g., cardiomyopathies; muscular dystrophy), neural tissue (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Alexander disease), lipodystrophies, and premature aging sydromes. IF proteins fulfill other functions in a differentiation and context-dependent fashion, including the response to apoptotic signals, protein targeting to subcellular compartments, cell signaling, subcellular organelle function and nuclear architecture and gene expression. This Gordon Research Conference (GRC) represents the only regular meeting devoted to IF biology. It brings together participants of junior and senior rank from all over the world, who study IF proteins from functional, regulatory, structural, and disease-related perspectives. This GRC has traditionally fostered a free-flowing exchange of novel ideas, tools and reagents, and facilitated the establishment of productive collaborations.

{"title":"Design and Delivery of Robust Hospital Environments in a Changing Climate (DeDeRHECC)","abstract":"The Department of Health (DH) and the NHS are particularly exercised by climate change. Whereas the occupants of other building types might consider raising their comfort temperature thresholds a little in summer and suspend the use of mechanical cooling, NHS patients' well being and safety may well be compromised by higher summer temperatures. In fact the DH and the NHS are hit by a double whammy, the pressure to reduce energy consumption, colliding with the pressure to protect their patients and staff from overheating, the dangers of which were manifest in recent years' summer heatwaves. Innovative low energy design strategies and techniques will be required both for new buildings and, most importantly, for the existing building stock, the 27,701,676 square metres of the NHS Retained Estate. However there are many barriers to the implementation of such innovative interventions in NHS buildings, patient safety being paramount. Worries include the inability to achieve stable temperature control and safe ventilation (the airborne transmission of pathogens is an emerging science as our colleague Dr.Cath Noakes freely admits), the proliferation in the use of medical equipment adding heat to hospital interiors and the mechanics of modern contractual arrangements which place private companies in charge of the Facilities Management of health buildings, which, unsurprisingly, given the penalties they face, are ultra-cautious about adopting change.This project, 'Design and delivery of Robust Hospital Environments in a Changing Climate' (DeDeRHECC), will investigate these conundra to come up with economical and practical low energy refurbishment strategies for existing hospitals. It will derive a closer definition of resilience in the context of an acute hospital and, most particularly, the criteria set for hospital environments for the various categories of space found in hospitals; non-clinical, patient rooms, diagnostic and treatment, even operating theatres. The team is sceptical that these all align into a cherent requirement and will review UK and US criteria. Using four sets of hospital sites drawn from the project's four participating major NHS Trusts, it will 'catalogue' basic hospital building types from this sizeable sample of NHS stock, identify those most frequently occurring, assess their current resilience to climate change and propose appropriate solutions or clusters of interventions for each 'type'. It will model these ideas so that relative energy savings can be quantified and their resilience to warming external temperatures determined. It will cost them. It will calculate the lifetime running costs and energy savings and assess Value for Money. It will also examine the procurement environment in which these innovative solutions need to be delivered, the protocols by which refurbishment projects are designed, approved and implemented. Their delivery will incur risks. The project will take innovative risk assessment tools for change, developed for engineering design, and apply them to these future large and medium scale construction projects. It will develop processes to make the integration of these innovative, low energy interventions into hospital refurbishment projects smoother and more familiar to those who will be delivering them. It will produce guidance and worked examples in text and web form and, most significantly, as a DVD film of participants discussing the challenges, their anxieties, the ideas and how to deliver them.

{"title":"Isotope dilutions as a method of verification of the sample preparation method in the bioimaging of soft tissues by the LA-ICP-MS method","abstract":"New strategies for the quantitative imaging of the distribution of elements in animal tissues by laser ablation combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry Laser ablation combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is used for direct elemental analysis of solids . The result of the measurement can be data on many elements present in the sample over a very wide concentration range, and therefore information on both the main components and the elements present at the trace level. The LA-ICP-MS method enables an insight into the distribution of elements on the surface of the sample, causing changes in the sample at the level of microdamages. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of this method in the analysis of biological and clinical samples, ranging from research into disease mechanisms and drug effects in animal models, to prototypes for routine analyzes of human biopsy material. Unfortunately, due to the high water content and the activity of microorganisms in soft tissues after their removal from the body, attention should be paid to their instability. Each of the currently used methods of sample fixation may affect its chemical composition, and in addition, during the ICP-MS analysis, additional requirements appear (e.g. flat surface of the analyzed object) forcing specific preparation methods, which may interfere with the primary distribution of elements. The method of collecting material in the LA-ICP-MS method is quite strongly dependent on the type of matrix; The laser beam interacts differently with dark tissue with a high water content, and differently with dry and light tissue. The literature emphasizes the need to select standards that are as close as possible to the sample in terms of composition and structure, which is very difficult in the case of biological and clinical analyzes. There are no patterns of unfixed tissues on the market, which is an obvious consequence of their instability. The available lyophilized materials are already subjected to a treatment, which the analyzed sample will not necessarily undergo, and the degree of their homogeneity, satisfactory in the methods requiring transfer to a solution, is insufficient in the LA-ICP-MS microanalyses. It is proposed each time to make solid patterns imitating a protein matrix, e.g. based on gelatin, but it is a time-consuming, little repeatable procedure, and not fully ensuring matrix compliance. An innovative approach to quantitative analysis of tissues with the LA-ICP-MS method is the use of the isotope dilution method (ID-MS). This type of calibration measures the ratios of specific isotopes of a given element, which remain constant regardless of the matrix. The aim of the project is to systematically analyze the impact of the available methods of preparing soft tissues for LA-ICP-MS tests on changes in the content of selected elements with the use of ID-MS calibration. The influence of drying and freeze-drying as well as microtome and cryotomic cutting will be assessed. The preliminary tests showed significant changes in the signal intensity for selected elements after lyophilization and a much lower effect of drying. However, the obtained results require quantitative confirmation using an absolute, matrix-independent method. The research plan includes the preparation of commercially available animal organ samples using the above-mentioned methods, and then the development of a calibration methodology using ID-MS. The obtained results will be analyzed with the use of statistical methods in order to find out the differences between the methods of sample preparation. The expected result of the project is the development of universal guidelines for the preparation of a soft tissue sample for analysis using the LA-ICP-MS method.","for_first_level_name":"Chemical Sciences","mesh_terms":["Animals","Gelatin","Humans","Laser Therapy","Mass Spectrometry","Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"]}
{"title":"COMPLEX RARE EARTH FLUORIDES:  NEW SCINTILLATION CRYSTAL","abstract":"This researrch is directed to the development of methods of growing single crystals of complex fluoride materials based on EuMgF4, whose remarkable photoluminescent properties have been described in a publication from this laboratory. Preliminary studies have shown that these materials also fluoresce intensely under X-ray excitation. It is proposed to prepare solid solutions of up to 75 mole% EuMgF4 in BaMgF4 and develop methods for the growth of single crystals ofsuch solid solutions. The fluorescense is due to the excitation of the Eu2+ ion and peaks in the blue region of the spectrum at about 440nm. Maximum efficiency is at 75 mole% EuMgF4, providing a high capture cross-section for x-radiation. Preliminary crystal growth studies will be done on the isomorphous system BaMgF4-SrMgF4. When crystals are available, studies of their sensitivity to X-ray excitation will be carried out. Photoluminescence studies and measurement of other physical properties over a range of temperatures will be made to assist our understanding of the physical processes in the crystals. The development of crystals of this type will be very useful for such applications of X-rays at CAT scanners, array devices, etc., because the high X-ray absorption and the high concentration of luminescent ions permit the use of very small crystals for improved resolution. The chemical nature of these insoluble fluorides avoids the hygroscopic nature of most present scintillation crystals. Some attempts to couple the luminescent output to photoconductive cells such as CdS will be made as a prototype of a miniature solid-state detector suitable for use in diagnostic devices such as CAT scanners.","for_first_level_name":"Chemical Sciences","mesh_terms":["Crystallization","Europium","Fluorides","Luminescence","Luminescent Measurements"]}

{"title":"Concerted effort - AI within city and real estate planning, construction and management - start-up phase","abstract":"Sweden\u2019s construction sector is generally behind other countries when it comes to the application of AI. Whilst AI provides an opportunity to generate smarter and more sustainable solutions, the sector is nowhere near taking advantage of its potential. Tests often take place on a smaller scale without being mainstreamed. One of the main reasons for this is a low level of knowledge of AI among stakeholders as well as lack of specialist AI competences within organisations. It is against this background that the project has been formulated. One of the purposes of the project is to form a knowledge platform for AI within the community that generates insights amongst the sector\u00b4s players about AI\u00b4s potential, including business and societal gains, that can be the starting point for continued strategic investments. In order to achieve this, a number of activities are planned including use cases, horizon scanning, tailored support, international collaboration and knowledge-sharing. The use cases will include developing and testing practical AI solutions with industry stakeholders, ecosystem actors and AI specialists. They will span planning, production\/design, and management. The goal of these use cases is to develop scalable solutions that create and demonstrate business and societal benefits, where experiences are shared openly and transparently to inspire others. Horizon scanning helps to identify exciting AI applications both in Sweden and abroad with the aim to inspire sector actors to start working with AI.The following application describes the strategic project in its entirety even though this particular application specifically refers to the financing of the project\u00b4s start-up phase.

{"title":"AGU Chapman Conference on Hawaiian Volcanoes: From Source to Surface","abstract":"Chapman Conferences are topic meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union and are designed to promote opportunities to discuss scientific issues that are not normally available at larger meetings. Intellectual Merits. Studies of Hawaiian volcanoes have had a profound impact on the development of volcanology, especially over the past century. Frequent eruptive activity and ease of access make Hawaii a natural laboratory for volcanology as epitomized by establishment of the Hawaii Volcano Observatory in 1912. Since then, Hawaiian volcanoes have served as a testing ground for models of magma ascent, storage, transport, and eruption, with results applicable to similar volcanoes worldwide and on other planets. Hawaii is the paradigm for hotspot volcanism, and is a key element in models of global tectonics and mantle structure. In addition, activity of Hawaiian volcanoes has spurred technological developments that have led to outstanding advances in geophysical methods, leading to state-of-the-art seismic and geodetic networks that have been replicated at many other volcanoes worldwide. A Chapman conference on Hawaiian Volcanoes will be held August 20-24, 2012, the same year that the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory marks the Centennial of its founding. This occasion provides an opportunity to review the state-of-the-art in understanding of how Hawaiian volcanoes work and to assess the most important problems requiring future research. The conference will occur over 5 days and will include both invited and contributed talks, as well as posters. Topical sessions will be organized to follow a packet of magma from its point of origin in the mantle, through subvolcanic plumbing systems, to eruption at the surface, as a means of discussing observations and models of magma origin, ascent, and eruption. The last day will feature discussion of future research goals in Hawaii, and how work on Hawaiian volcanoes can drive development of new technologies and methodologies in the Earth sciences. One day in the middle of the conference schedule will be devoted to field trips to offer attendees a chance to explore areas of volcanic interest around the island and interact with colleagues in an informal setting. Pre- and post-meeting field trips will also be available to maximize participant exposure to Hawaiian volcanoes. Broader Impacts. The conference conveners will encourage broad participation and especially hope to attract graduate students and early career scientists, because they represent the next generation of Earth scientists and future leaders in their fields. Interactions between young researchers and experienced scientists will provide a forum for information transfer in both directions. The conveners are considering publishing an AGU monograph entitled ?Hawaiian Volcanoes: From Source to Surface,? that will summarize the current state-of-knowledge of Hawaiian volcanism.

{"title":"Collaborative Research: What lies beneath: An investigation of subglacial silicic magma systems (Vatnajokull, Iceland)","abstract":"Iceland is positioned where a mid-ocean ridge and a mantle plume intersect at high latitude, resulting in dynamic and dangerous volcano-ice interactions. Two of Iceland\u2019s four most historically active volcanoes (Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn and B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga) occur near the intersection of the ridge and plume, but they are largely obscured from view by Vatnaj\u00f6kull, an ice cap that covers ~10% of Iceland\u2019s surface area. There are indications that glacial retreat can lead to increased eruption rates by destabilizing existing magma bodies and even prompting new magma generation. As climate continues to change and Iceland\u2019s ice caps continue to thin, there is increasing concern about the impacts on subglacial volcanic systems and their associated hazards. It is important to better understand past and present behavior of subglacial volcanic systems to better prepare for future volcanic threats. The primary objective of this study is to explore the origin, evolution, age, and longevity of magmas under Vatnaj\u00f6kull in order to better understand Iceland\u2019s glacio-volcanic hazard potential, while simultaneously learning about a geologically unique part of the world. This work will strengthen existing, and facilitate new, collaborations with domestic and international scientists in the field and in analytical labs. It will also create opportunity for community engagement and public education, and provide rigorous research experiences for 6+ undergraduate students, a majority of whom are from traditionally under-represented backgrounds. In Iceland, silicic material accounts for ~10% of the exposed crust; at central volcanoes, this amount increases to ~30%. Volcanic systems beneath Vatnaj\u00f6kull appear to have a paucity of silicic material relative to their subaerial counterparts. This may be a consequence of the proximity to the ridge-plume intersection, or (more likely) a consequence of poor exposure leading to sample bias. Since silicic magmas have the potential to erupt more explosively and with greater associated hazards than basaltic magmas, it is important to understand the role they may play at the productive, active, systems obscured from view by Vatnaj\u00f6kull. The research questions to be investigated are: To what extent are silicic materials associated with B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga, Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn, and neighboring Kverkfj\u00f6ll? Are collected silicic materials from active magmatic systems, older bedrock, or a combination? How do the geochemical characteristics of these systems\u2019 silicic materials compare to those in the known rock record elsewhere in Iceland? What hazards do silicic magmas present in this dynamic rift-mantle plume-ice environment? Data generated in this study will facilitate mapping the regional distribution of subglacial silicic materials (both those associated with active volcanic systems and those from older bedrock). Evidence from nunatak and moraine rocks (major and trace elements; Hf, Nd, and Pb isotopes; petrography) and their accessory minerals (zircon: U-Th and U-Pb dates, O and Hf isotopes, trace elements; apatite: trace elements, volatiles) will make it possible to decipher the petrogenetic origins and evolution of silicic systems at Iceland\u2019s most plume-affected, and most active, central volcanoes. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.","for_first_level_name":"Earth Sciences","mesh_terms":["Antarctic Regions","Humans","Ice Cover","Iceland","Volcanic Eruptions"]}

{"title":"US-EU productivity differential at the industry level: the role of embodied technology progress","abstract":"The last decade has witnessed the resurgence of United States (US) productivity and the contemporaneous decline of that of the European Union (EU). This productivity gap means that Europe is falling behind the US and it may therefore be difficult to maintain the European standard of living. The current research explores the causes of the aforementioned divergence by adopting a multi-sector framework. It is submitted that a multi-sector framework offers a preferential model for identification of sources of productivity slowdown as compared with a one-sector model. By departing from the standard one-sector model it is possible to identify additional sources of productivity slowdown, for example (1) the distance of the European investment goods sectors from the technological frontier, (2) the slower adoption process of new investment goods by the European consumption goods sectors.\n\nThese two alternative sources of productivity differential are estimated by applying a dynamic factor model to US and EU sectoral data (GGDC data set). With this econometric technique, each variable is decomposed into components that are industry-specific but common across nations, and components that are nation-specific but common across industries. By estimating sector- or national-specific dynamic factors it is possible to: (1) determine the European sectors for which the country-component accounts for more than the sectoral one in order to explain productivity dynamics; (2) estimate the correlation of the variance explained by the sector-component with other explanatory variables; (3) identify the heterogeneous responses of EU and the US to common shocks.\n\nThis project provides valuable input into the debate about realizing the Lisbon Agenda. According to the recent Sapir report, both innovation and reforms are central triggers for the European growth process. The proposed empirical analysis and the multi-sector framework will contribute to the discussion on this policy debate.\n\n","for_first_level_name":"Economics","mesh_terms":["Europe","European Union","United States"]}
{"title":"Investing wisely: using economic modelling to optimize public health strategies to reduce harm from alcohol, tobacco and cannabis and optimize benefits in British Columbia","abstract":"Substance use costs British Columbia $4.9 billion in 2014, of which 70% was due to alcohol and tobacco. These estimates include costs related to the use of health care resources, productivity losses, criminal justice, and other direct costs such as accidents, research and prevention. Broader societal costs not included in these estimates relate to inequities, marginalization and hindered social development.  This project aims to develop a model to evaluate the economic and social impact of legal substance use harm prevention in British Columbia. Evidence on economic consequences and how public health programs can minimize costs and harms from substance use is important for policy makers, who need to consider the health system priorities against efficiency, scalability and sustainability of interventions. The challenges to developing comprehensive economic evaluations in public health are well known. In the area of substance use, these pertain to the multitude of the socioeconomic determinants that influence use - such as employment, income, social exclusion, and hopelessness - and the difficulty of measuring broader benefits including family wellbeing, community development and equity gains.   This fellowship will facilitate collaboration between knowledge users and academics with the aim of optimizing investment in the area of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis harm prevention in BC. It will provide the Ministry of Health with tools to implement efficient priority setting that aligns with the institution's values and development goals. This will be achieved through important methodological advances to allow evaluations to account for the broader societal impact of preventing harm from legal substance use in BC. As a result, this fellowship will sustain future research in health economics with an increased ability to respond to policy makers' needs when it comes to priority setting.","for_first_level_name":"Economics","mesh_terms":["British Columbia","Harm Reduction","Health Care Costs","Health Policy","Humans","Public Health","Substance-Related Disorders"]}
{"title":"US-Canadian Softwood Lumber Trade: A Case of Perfectly Fungible Products","abstract":"In May 2002, the US International Trade Commission (USITC) placed a countervailing duty of 18.79% on Canadian softwood lumber imports based on the premise that no difference exists between US and Canadian softwood lumber species and that Canadian producers receive stumpage subsidies. The USITC assumption was that the product requirements in all end-use markets for softwood lumber can be met across all available North American species. The USITC based its analysis of the fungible nature of softwood lumber on aggregate market analyses of cross-price elasticity of demand estimates across species\/species groupings. The objective of this research is to develop and implement a product-market level conjoint model to measure substitutability of softwood lumber species in North America. The model will be developed and tested on disaggregated softwood lumber markets through a survey of the US homebuilder market. These end-use markets represent the vast majority of softwood\nlumber used in the US, yet they are very distinct from one another with regard to performance requirements. Estimated conjoint model parameters will be used to derive cross-price elasticities of demand. Elasticity results will be used to assess whether softwood lumber species and species groups are substitutes in specific end-use markets as suggested by USITC decisions. Research results that point toward distinct differences in the substitutability between North American species\/species groups of lumber would have considerable implications in future USITC analyses of the US-Canadian softwood lumber trade issue.","for_first_level_name":"Economics","mesh_terms":["Canada","Commerce","Internationality","North America","United States"]}
{"title":"Profitability for Small Beef Producers through Sustainable Forage Systems and Value Added Forage Fed Beef Production","abstract":"Research conducted over 20 years ago showed that forage-finished beef could be produced using forage resources available in the Southeastern U.S. In general, producers in this region have small numbers of cows (less than 100) and 90% of the calves weigh less than 600 lb at weaning, leaving them with few marketing opportunities for calves. Few producers have enough calves to market in a truck load (48,000 lb). Marketing alliances among small and medium-sized producers have had limited success. Trucking costs (increased due to the rise in fuel costs), sharp declines in export markets, and increased cow numbers are all factors that are affecting beef producer capacity to compete in the calf market. Environmental concerns, food safety recalls, health concerns, and a changing domestic demographic have encouraged beef producers to look for alternative production methods to keep the industry viable. Consumer interest in the benefits of forage-finished beef has led to increased demand for this product. The successful niche marketer will target poorly served consumers, identify their needs, and produce a consistent, high-quality product to meet the demand. Throughout the U.S., with the Southeast no exception, consumer demand for \"organic\" and \"natural\" foods is increasing. In 2006, there was annual growth in sales of 20 and 42% for natural and organic meats, respectively. Adding to this trend, consumers are more inclined to support locally produced products. This is a particularly attractive means for Southeastern small- and medium-sized beef cattle producers to add value to their land and capital resources in a growing market sector. According to SARE (Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education) the three pillars of sustainability are: PROFIT over the long term, STEWARDSHIP of our nation's land, air and water, and QUALITY OF LIFE for farmers, ranchers and their communities. Through better grazing management (stocking rate, rotational stocking, water distribution), fertilization practices (if needed), and use of the appropriate biological type of animal for the region, a cow-calf operation can be transformed to incorporate stocker\/finishing. Today, improved infrastructure and different animal and plant genetics are available to integrate environmental and economic viability into agricultural production systems. Productivity and profitability of three-year long forage systems for forage-fed finishing steers will be evaluated. Meat characteristics and its nutritional value, as well as consumer preference will be studied. Surveys will add information on what consumers prefer and their willingness to pay for this product. This project will determine the most profitable strategies for producing and distributing forage-fed beef, and will address e-commerce entrepreneurial network development by inclusion of Louisiana Market Maker in the program. It will also evaluate producer and consumer perceptions that affect current production strategies and consumer preferences for forage-fed beef.","for_first_level_name":"Economics","mesh_terms":["Agriculture","Animal Feed","Animal Husbandry","Animals","Cattle","Dairying","Female","Humans","Male","Red Meat","United States"]}

Sustained economic growth in the last three decades, rapid growth in urbanization, and recent food policy changes have already raised Indonesia's food consumption levels and increased the share of protein from animal sources. As a consequence, its food import demand has also increased. The share of the U.S. in most imported commodities is very limited compared to its competitors including Argentina, Thailand, Australia, and India. A demand system specification will be used and augmented to account for dynamic adjustment, structural change, and product and source differentiation. Also, a systems approach in land allocation in crops is used and augmented to include product, spatial, and temporal disaggregation. The livestock supply is specified to ensure consistency in the underlying biological relationships of variables. The feed demand system accounts for the changing production structure. The objective of this\nstudy is to develop a food sector model for Indonesia that is theoretically consistent and has adequate commodity coverage and disaggregation to allow examination of implications of economic and demographic changes, domestic and trade policy alternatives, and productivity growth on grain and meat trade in Indonesia.

{"title":"The conceptual modernization of content and methodic support for courses in higher education for teachers of technical universities","abstract":"Nowadays there are very few educational researches conducted in the field of higher education and also the theoretical discipline - pedagogy of higher education has inadequate response in the academic field of our higher education institutions. It is generally believed that high schools are the top-level institutions in the educational systems, but constantly there exist criticism concerning the unequal levels of education quality and the overall quality of teaching process in these institutions. The requirement to improve the quality of university teaching is usually formulated as a challenge (such as the Bologna Declaration, 1999) or the recommendation of education policy documents (Adopted 1997, White Paper 2001), or it is the part of the evaluation reports of accreditation commissions or of the other evaluation and expert institutions. Even the universities in their development programs refer to the field of teaching process improvement. But less are the concrete changes and innovations enforced into educational practice, individual departments do not have support within the system of institutional changes. It is difficult to recommend general pedagogical principles, strategies and methods in a variety of learning situations that have a different character at higher levels than at lower levels of education and therefore there is an urgent need to develop pedagogy of higher education. On the other hand, there are various barriers and adverse circumstances of economic origin or consist of human resources and also it should be taken into account the legal guarantee of academic freedom in higher education. According to the above mentioned thoughts we note that there are many factors that determine the concept of university education, which requires a deeper examination of this issue. Therefore, the aim of this research project is a conceptual analysis and curriculum innovation in the field of pedagogy of higher education, to design the content of higher education courses for university teachers of technical orientation, their modernization in line with the latest requirements of the current scientific knowledge and needs of social practice. In the lifelong learning programs for university teachers is needed to watch both professional growth and particularly the educational and psychological preparation of individual teaching staff as part of obtaining scientific degrees and scientific-pedagogical titles.","for_first_level_name":"Education","mesh_terms":["Curriculum","Humans","Teaching","Universities"]}

In the dynamic interactive relationship between the facilitator and the student, the student has the right to receive quality education which will enable him or her to function as an independent practitioner with critical and analytical thinking skills and be able to provide quality nursing. The paradigmatic perspective that guides this research is based on metatheoretical, theoretical and methodological assumptions. The expectations of students regarding quality nursing education in the private health care services are explored by means of focus group interviews and these ideas are supported by literature searches. A questionnaire has been constructed to confirm these expectations as well as to explore the theological dimension of the identified expectations. Analysis of the resultant data has enabled the generation of specific statements which embody the expectations with respect to the facilitator, nursing education and the system. The conceptual framework is described, based on the identified concepts, relevant national and international literature. From the analysis of the description of the conceptual framework, six main and related concepts are formulated, which have resulted in concise and clear statements on nursing care. A desirable quality improvement programme are drawn up by means of deductive and inductive reasoning from these statements.

{"title":"Mapping the Evolving Landscape of Child-Computer Interaction Research: Structures and Processes of Knowledge (Re)Production","abstract":"The intended study seeks to address identified knowledge gaps in current theory and empirical evidence, whilst furthering existing understanding in the burgeoning field of transfer of learning from virtual environments in early childhood. Furthermore, the proposed study would investigate the viability of the construct of motivation of transfer in early childhood education and assess its impact upon transfer of learning from virtual environments. Additionally, the intended study would consider the impact of forms of feedback, which is regarded as an important aspect of a dynamic conception of learning transfer. An analogous structure to that availed of in similar studies reviewed (e.g. Tarasuik, Demaria & Kaufman, 2017) will be employed, whereby initial tasks will be completed in virtual environments, followed by near and far transfer tasks. A control group will exist, which will complete comparable initial learning tasks availing of traditional, non-digital media. Similar to Kirkorian, Choi and Pempek (2016), conditions will also be constructed to reflect varying degrees of contingency or salience, through modification of interactivity involved in tasks (contingent, semi-contingent, noncontingent) as this has been found to exert significant influence upon transfer of learning through moderation of both cognitive load (Choi & Kirkorian, 2016) and dual representation (DeLoache, 2000). However, review of literature and identification of its shortcomings, as well as the specific intentions of the proposed study, necessitate revision and modification of this structure in order to address the hypotheses of the proposed study.\nFirstly, delay testing will be adopted, as recommended by previous studies (e.g. Zack & Barr, 2016), which it is believed will more accurately represent learners' transfer. Furthermore, testing will incorporate a \"graduated prompting\" (Newman et al.,1989) in order to facilitate a conception of transfer as active - a perspective which has ostensibly been neglected in previous studies concerning transfer of learning in early childhood. In this conception of transfer of learning as an active process, transfer is understood as stimulating increased speed in learning in new domains as opposed to enabling spontaneous transfer of appropriate knowledge. \"Graduated prompting\" (Campione and Brown, 1987; Newman et al.,1989) enables assessment through analysis of the amount of aid required before learners are able to transfer learning. While results of studies reviewed may be construed as resulting from either a cognitive load theoretical or dual representative perspective, with outcomes manifesting similarly and potentially comorbid, it is the intent of the proposed study to, insomuch as it is possible, differentiate between these two perspectives. While it is difficult to definitively mitigate the possibility of either cognitive load or dual representation influencing transfer to some extent in any given task, a possible remedy has been identified which may circumvent this difficulty. A condition may be constructed wherein an adapted version of the \"credible shrinking room\" experiment (DeLoache, Miller, & Rosengren, 1997) may be employed, whereby it is intimated to learners' that materials used in assessment have a direct physical relation to those involved in the initial learning task, thereby negating the need to dual represent. While this may also reduce the cognitive load on learners, literature has proposed that it is the interactive aspects and superfluous content of virtual learning tasks which result in cognitive overload, and as such this alteration will not substantially preclude cognitive overload. Thus, it will be possible, to a reasonable extent, to identify more accurately the impact on transfer of learning attributable to cognitive load, and subsequently dual representation capacities.","for_first_level_name":"Education","mesh_terms":["Cognition","Feedback","Humans","Learning","Motivation","Transfer, Psychology"]}

However, the existing algorithms for school bus routing problem (SBRP) were proposed mainly to solve a specific and simplified routing problem, and thus are difficult to be used in actual school bus route planning. This project aims to develop a hyper-heuristic algorithm for solving the general-purpose SBRP. The research focuses on four topics: the definition of general-purpose SBRP; the design and implementation of a hyper-heuristic algorithm for SBRP; the performance analysis and calibration of the proposed algorithm; and the case studies. The research will be conducted in the following steps: (1) the mathematical definition and model formulation of SBRP according to various planning scenarios and the characteristics of the problem. (2) The design of a metaheuristic framework consisting of the common algorithm components and the low-level heuristic library, the building of the high-level strategies based on learning mechanism, and the implementation of a hyper-heuristic algorithm based on this framework. (3) The comprehensive testing of the low-level heuristics and high-level hyper-heuristic strategies on a set of SBRP benchmark instances, mainly focusing on the suitability and performance of the algorithm selection strategies on different routing problems and different spatiotemporal configurations of the problem instances. (4) The case studies of school bus routes planning by using the proposed hyper-heuristic algorithm in GIS. The research findings will contribute to the general-purpose and high-performance algorithm design for SBRP.

Weight reduction must also be cost effective for consumers, meet or exceed current and planned safety requirements, meet consumer expectations for vehicle performance and durability. The current brake systems consisting of rotors and calipers made of cast iron are heavy and normally experience severe corrosion. Aluminum is an excellent candidate material for brake applications. The major technical barriers preventing the use of aluminum in brake rotor\u00a0 applications include poor wear resistance and inability to withstand elevated surface temperatures generated during braking. The proposed solution is to develop an innovative aluminum brake system consisting of four steel clad aluminum (SCA) rotors, four aluminum calipers and four aluminum wheels for passenger cars, which utilizes the connected aluminum wheel as the major heat sink\/radiator to dissipate braking heat more efficiently, resulting in significantly lower brake working temperatures. The proposed technology also includes a reliable steel and aluminum bonding technique which incorporates steel with a higher pad\/rotor friction coefficient and dozens of slots to increase braking friction and eliminate the problem of steel and aluminum thermal mismatch. The proposed technology will save over 30% cast iron brake rotor weight at a cost increase of less than $5\/lb-saved without compromising brake performance. The objective of the combined Phase I\/Phase II project is to demonstrate technical and mass production feasibilities of the proposed technology for OEM applications. In the Phase I project, several SCA rotors for 2011 Ford Focus front brake were manufactured and tested by Link Engineering Laboratories according to the test procedures: 1) Federal motor vehicle safety standard 135 test; 2) City, rural, and highway wear test; and 3) Squeal noise propensity. Road test of a car mounted with the rotors followed. The research provided the needed results of overcoming the technical hurdle of very tight disc thickness variation (DTV) control and reaching the DTV goal of not greater than 0.0002\u201d for new rotors and 0.0005\u201d for rotors in service. In the Phase II project, mass production of a SCA rotor will be demonstrated in collaboration with manufacturing partners. In addition, the SCA rotor will be selected by an automaker aiming at commercial application and go through the quality verification process. The proposed aluminum brake system aims at replacing the widely used cast iron brake systems and will reduce 20-60 pounds of unsprung weight for a passenger car and promise 2-4% energy savings for vehicles. If successfully developed and commercialized, the proposed technology could save huge amounts of gasoline every year, worth over 10 billion dollars and reduce enormous amounts of CO2, CO, hydrocarbons, and NOx emissions annually in the US. In addition, the SCA rotors are produced using metal mold casting, which are much more environmentally friendly than the sand mold casting process used by cast iron rotors.","for_first_level_name":"Engineering","mesh_terms":["Aluminum","Corrosion","Steel"]}

{"title":"Smart Nano-Structured Titania-Based MEMS Multi-Gas Sensor for High Temperature and Harsh Fossil Environment Applications","abstract":"Rising demands on fossil fuel power systems to lower pollution levels and increase efficiency introduces a need to accurately detect and quantify emission gasses. Novel sensors capable of monitoring gasses throughout a fossil fuel power system will improve regulatory monitoring capabilities and enable energy- -saving practices. Micro- -Electro- -Mechanical- -System (MEMS) based gas sensors have shown promise in measuring gas concentrations in various environments, but several barriers still remain to the implementing MEMS gas sensors in high temperature power generation systems: (1) fast degradation of materials under harsh environments \u00a0at \u00a0temperatures \u00a0> \u00a0500\u00b0C, \u00a0(2) \u00a0insufficient \u00a0reliability \u00a0of \u00a0detected signals, (3) lack of selectivity for sensing specific gasses in mixed- -gas environments, and (4) difficulty in scaling to produce advanced multi- -sensor \u00a0platforms capable of sensing multiple gasses simultaneously. The goal of this work is to introduce an advanced titania- -based multivariate MEMS gas sensor that overcomes the debilitating factors previously mentioned. Our approach is to use oxidation- -resistant substrates such as (Ti,Al,Cr) alloys to produce arrays of doped nano- -structured \u00a0TiO2 MEMS gas sensors and combine these on a single platform. A single- -platform, multi- -sensor system enables us to accurately detect multiple gasses simultaneously including O2, H2, CO2 and NOx. The sensor is designed \u00a0to \u00a0be \u00a0effective \u00a0in \u00a0harsh, \u00a0multi- -gas \u00a0environments \u00a0at \u00a0temperatures \u00a0and pressures ranging from 20\u00b0C to 1200\u00b0C and 15 to 1000 psi. The proposed sensor is based on several subsystems, each of them dedicated to the detection of a specific gas, and constituted of 64 MEMS sensors. Contrary to previous approaches based on solo sensors, all 64 redundant sensors of each subsystem are dedicated to detecting a single target. Nanostructured TiO2 (NST)\u00a0layers will be used as the sensing material, and will be doped with elements such as Pt, Al or Cr to increase the MEMS sensor sensitivity to a specific targeted gas. The detecting signals are collected from each individual sensor and processed using multi- -sensor\u00a0 \u00a0data \u00a0fusion \u00a0technology. \u00a0Data \u00a0fusion \u00a0will \u00a0be \u00a0utilized \u00a0to \u00a0efficiently compare and combine the collected data from multiple sensors to provide reliable and accurate signals not achievable with a single sensor. The primary application of the proposed sensor will be to monitor emitted combustion gasses for coal power generation plants, gas turbines, and gasifiers. The value incentive for end users is to accurately monitor gas concentrations to improve system efficiency, minimize ware on equipment, and produce accurate emissions reports for regulatory purposes.

{"title":"In situ analysis of thermal degradation of selective coating for solar energy applications","abstract":"Purpose and goal:\nThe purpose of the project is to perform a feasibility study on how to use Large Science Facilities (LSF) to analyze the thermal degradation of a solar selective coating. The goal is to formulate a detailed plan for an in situ analysis of the chemical composition and morphology during thermal degradation of the coating.\n\nExpected results and effects:\nIn a solar collector, the solar selective coating is applied on the receiver to give it high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance. The receiver is heated to high temperatures during operation, meaning that thermal stability is the most essential durability aspect of such a coating. Getting a good understanding for the thermal degradation process is therefore a necessary step towards commercialization. The use of LSFs will enable a more detailed analysis than what would otherwise be possible, greatly benefiting Absolicon by increasing this understanding.\n\nApproach and implementation:\nThe solar selective coating has, in close collaboration between Absolicon and Ume\u00e5 University, been developed and characterized to the extent that is possible at the University. Initial experiments towards scale up are currently being prepared by Absolicon who have also patented the coating as a preparation towards commercialization.

{"title":"Spatial Ecology and Expansion of Recolonizing Black Bear Populations in Eastern Oklahoma","abstract":"A spatial understanding of how and why a recolonizing large predator species moves through a human-dominated landscape is essential to predict future areas of expansion of the species, predict and mitigate human-wildlife conflict, provide directed outreach and education to humans in areas of overlap with the predators, and conserve and manage the predator species for its ecological and recreational (consumptive and non-consumptive) values. With black bears recolonizing eastern Oklahoma from Arkansas, after having disappeared from Oklahoma in the early 1900s, our study will use satellite telemetry and spatial analyses to study the variable densities of black bears on the landscape, produce a more accurate population size estimate, identify and model factors that affect young, dispersing black bears when searching for a new home range, and incorporate human acceptance of black bears into a spatial framework to predict areas in the human-dominated landscape in which black bears might be able to persist. The results of our study will inform management of Oklahoma&#39;s black bear populations, as well as neighboring states, and develop practices that will help to reduce bear-human conflict while maintaining healthy populations of black bears in eastern Oklahoma.

{"title":"Climatic and Anthropogenic Impacts on African Ecosystems (CLANIMAE) (PHASE II)","abstract":"Context\nThe magnitude and geographic reach of human impact on Earth\u2019s biosphere has increased rapidly over the last 100 years, in particular in equatorial East Africa where rates of population growth and the intensification of agriculture are among the highest in the world, and where developing economies strongly depend on water and other goods and services provided by natural ecosystems. Economic development with conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning requires spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of the timing and relative magnitude of ancient and modern human impact on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to 1) evaluate the current health of ecosystems and their resilience to anthropogenic impact, 2) model the range of their possible responses to future climate change, and from these 3) develop locally optimal strategies for land and water-resource management.\nProject description\nGlobal studies of historical land use have focused on large-scale landscape modifications that can potentially affect global climate via their effects on surface albedo, aerosols, and the carbon cycle. These studies concluded that the impact of pre-colonial cultures on natural ecosystems in East Africa was limited, due to very low mean population density (~3% of today\u2019s population in 1700 AD). This contrasts with the common paradigms in archaeology that human ancestors impacted the East African landscape from Palaeolithic times onwards, and that the onset of significant anthropogenic deforestation must be situated at least 2500 years ago, following the introduction of iron metallurgy by Bantu immigrants.\nCLANIMAE responds to the urgent need of a correct long-term perspective to today\u2019s climate-environment-human interactions in tropical East Africa, by simultaneous high-resolution reconstruction of both past climatic variability and the history of vegetation and water-quality changes through multi-disciplinary analyses of dated lake-sediment records. The climate reconstructions will integrate information on biological, geochemical and sedimentological proxy indicators of past changes in the water balance of study lakes. Several relevant data sets are already available, while others will be provided, at no cost to this project, by in-house doctoral thesis projects or foreign collaborators in complementary research initiatives. Reconstruction of past terrestrial vegetation dynamics will be executed within this project and based on analyses of fossil plant pollen and phytoliths in sediment records from lakes situated along the climatological gradient from (sub)humid western Uganda to semi-arid eastern Kenya. The evolution of water quality through time will be reconstructed using paleoecological analyses of fossil diatoms and aquatic macrophytes, following calibration of diatom and macrophyte species distribution against lake trophic status and turbidity in the modern-day regional lake gradient. Special attention will be given to the validation of silicon isotopes in diatom opal as proxy indicator for past diatom productivity, and to the stratigraphy of fossil fungal spores associated with the excrements of large domestic animals as indicators of lake use by indigenous pastoralists.\nSpecific research activities funded by the Belgian federal science policy include the reconstruction of past vegetation dynamics and pastoralist activity through analyses of fossil pollen and fungal spores (UGent-Limnology, co\u00f6rdinator); silicon-isotope geochemistry and the monitoring of modern lake ecosystems (RMCA-Tervuren, partner 2); aquatic macrophyte paleoecology (FUSA-Gembloux, partner 3); and diatom paleoecology (National Botanic Garden-Meise, partner 4), the two latter methods as indicators of past water quality. Pollen data on vegetation history will partly be provided through a sub-contract of UGent with expert palynologists in Kenya (Dr. S. M. Rucina, NMK Nairobi) en Uganda (Dr. I. Ssemmanda, U.Kampala). Phytolith data on the past occurrence of domesticated banana in Uganda will be obtained through an informal collaboration agreement with Dr. J. Lejju (U.Mbarara). A co-financed collaboration with the York Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Dynamics (UK; partner 5) contributes expertise on the long-term dynamics of African terrestrial ecosystems and on the archaeology of East Africa. Other long-standing collaboration agreements with international partners will provide complementary data and materials that further contribute to the regional-scale assessment of past climatic and anthropogenic impacts on African ecosystems.\nAn essential characteristic of the integrated paleoecological research method of this project is that it will address the question of past climate-environment-human relationships at the time scale at which the relevant processes have actually occurred. This will allow us to 1) separate the influences of natural climate variability and human activity on East African terrestrial ecosystems, 2) determine the exact timing and relative magnitude of indigenous (pre-20th century) anthropogenic land clearance compared to recent landscape alteration, and 3) determine the severity of lake water-quality losses due to siltation and excess nutrient input directly linked to deforestation and agriculture, compared to those associated with natural long-term hydrological change.\nPartners\nCoordinator\nDirk Verschuren\nGhent University\nLimnology Unit, Department of Biology\nK.

However, these are hearings of situation judgments and subjective opinions and thoughts based on people's living conditions, and it cannot be said that the hygiene conditions of the living environment are not necessarily scientifically consistent, so as a supplementary survey 2017 Visited the site in the latter half of December of the year to check for E. coli in drinking water. In order to compare the management forms, 20 households, 12 private farms, 16 semi-public farms, 1 semi-public farm school, and 1 Deniyaya city, which have cooperated with the field survey, total 50. Four samples were taken from the laboratory and examined for the condition of E. coli and coliforms. In private farms and semi-public farms, there are many tenement type houses, so a long tube drawn from the source is attached to the back of each house to obtain drinking water or drinking water from a shared tank. Since there are many households, the number of households has decreased. Initially, it was estimated that the number of E. coli was lower in farmers with a long education period and in households with water supply in their residences, but the experimental results show that the number of E. coli is not necessarily high because of the water supply in the farm or in the house. I couldn't say. In addition, because it shares drinking water, it cannot be said that there are many E. coli, and even in the same source, the number of E. coli varied considerably depending on the household. What we found from this experiment is that access to safe drinking water does not differ depending on the management form, and it cannot be said that there is an unsanitary condition due to the presence or absence of sharing of drinking water. Also, spring water, which did not seem to be hygienic at first glance, contained a small amount of E. coli, and it could be inferred that the number of E. coli was an important factor in the management of drinking water rather than the water source itself. The experiment on the farm could be conducted with the cooperation of the farm manager. We were informed that people who live in the farms will be given instructions to improve drinking water boiling and hygiene by providing media after E. coli culture and reporting the results.","for_first_level_name":"Environmental Sciences","mesh_terms":["Drinking Water","Escherichia coli","Family Characteristics","Farmers","Humans","Hygiene","Surveys and Questionnaires","Water Microbiology","Water Quality","Water Supply"]}
{"title":"Remotely piloted aircraft as a strategy to monitor fires and monitor ecological restoration in protected areas.","abstract":"Brazil has signed a commitment under international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement - COP 21 and the Bonn Challenge, to restore 12 million hectares of forests by 2030. The state of Mato Grosso also assumed responsibility for recovering 2.9 million hectares degraded until that date. These goals comprise one of the country's biggest challenges in terms of environmental policies for the coming decades. Uncontrolled burning and other types of land degradation cause immeasurable losses in terms of biodiversity and carbon stock reduction. The main product of the project will be the development of two Standard Operating Procedures (POPs) for the monitoring of heat sources and the recovery of degraded areas. Remotely Piloted Aircraft - ARP (drones) will be part of the POPs. These SOPs will cover a series of routines ranging from choosing the ideal ARP for the activities of diagnosis and monitoring of heat sources and recovery of degraded areas. In ARP terms, we will consider in the POPs, basic equipment review routines, flight operations, relevant legislation and data processing. These procedures will be an agile way of conducting training, providing the public and private sector with solutions related to meeting conflict management goals related to accidental fire control and restoration of ecosystems disturbed by fires.","for_first_level_name":"Environmental Sciences","mesh_terms":["Aircraft","Brazil","Conservation of Natural Resources","Ecosystem","Fires","Forests","Humans"]}
{"title":"The application potential of the metaphor on the pictorial image in a post-modern art context","abstract":"The purpose of this research is to determine the potential of applying the metaphor concept in the context of post-modern representational art.  The concept of metaphor- as symbolic form underlying the representational image in the practical component of this study - is in this way applied to the interpretation of representational images in the context of present-day aesthetic theory.  In section A, the nature of metaphor is identified as a universal human and multi-disciplinary phenomenon. After a definition is formulated, the processes of realization and interpretation, as well as the operation and functions of metaphor are investigated.  Section B offers a theoretical basis for the practical component of the research.  To contextualize the practical component, the post-modern movement in representational art is investigated according to present-day aesthetic norms. It is concluded - within the parameters of post-modern aesthetic norms and principles - that metaphor, as product of an active process of interaction, is a useful conceptual tool for the description of representational images.","for_first_level_name":"History and Archaeology","mesh_terms":["Art","Esthetics","Humans","Metaphor","Paintings"]}

{"title":"Bridging the Black Freedom Struggle: German and U.S.-American Perspectives","abstract":"The interdisciplinary network brings together German and U.S. scholars of American Studies, History, and Theology to work on the Black freedom struggle, understood as the long Civil Rights Movement, from a decidedly transatlantic perspective, i. e. Germany and the U.S. The network thus seeks to establish bridges between both countries, various disciplines,perspectives, anddifferent eras (CRM until today). Overall, the aim of the network is twofold: (1) to revisit selected aspects of the history and historiography of the Black freedom struggle. In doing so, we view the work toward Black liberation not just as a protest movement but conceptualize it as an on-going social movement, situating it at the nexus between history, cultural studies, and theology; (2) to highlight its continuing relevance not just in the U.S. but also in Europe and Germany in particular. Hence, we seek to uncover the historical and current socio-cultural readings of Blackness and whiteness. The network encompasses 14 members and 5 guest experts who \u2013 over the course of 2.5 years \u2013 focus on three key themes: mobilities, agencies, and representations. These themes will guide our three workshops dealing with Germany\u2019s role in the Black Atlantic, leadership hierarchies and the role of the Black Church within the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as new impulses of a transatlantic and diverse memory culture of the Black freedom struggle. An international conference will build on our workshops, both testing the transatlantic bridges and opening the dialogue through external scholars.The persistent existence of white supremacy and (unmarked) whiteness makes the continuation of the Black freedom struggle necessary to this day. The critical (self-)reflection on whiteness of the members as well as the diversity of topics with regard to various aspects contributes to less discriminatory practice in scholarship. Thus, the network also gives salience to racialized issues in Germany and critically discusses implications of Germany\u2019s (self-)perception and (re)presentation as white, untouched by blackness, colonialism, and slavery. Analyzing the scope of the Black freedom struggle entails a transnational perspective. Yet, U.S. scholars tend to only use English language (re)sources that makes it nearly impossible to look beyond national and ethnic borders. Our network adds to the predominantly English-speaking discourse, not just in terms of our language skills but mainly in terms of further diversifying and contributing to the debates that have shaped the (reception of the) Black freedom struggle outside the U.S. context. Accordingly, the network members assume a double role when \u2018bridging\u2019 the gap over the Atlantic, i. e. as mediators of scholarly discussions and by bringing in their respective perspective without falling into the trap of privileging a homogenous narrative.","for_first_level_name":"History and Archaeology","mesh_terms":["African Americans","Germany","History, 20th Century","Humans","United States"]}

{"title":"Masters of the stone: The stonecutters' workshops and the rise of the late antique epigraphical cultures (third-fifth century AD)","abstract":"\"The STONE-MASTERS project aims at exploring one of the most startling problems in the global history of research on collective memory and commemorative practices - the transformation of Roman Imperial epigraphic traditions in the later 3rd c. AD, and the subsequent rise of the so-called epigraphic cultures of Late Antiquity. The problem has been passionately debated since the 1980s, but so far no definite conclusions have been reached. In this project, the PI argues that the main reason for the transformation is to be ascribed to the dissemination of changes in the elite's approach to epigraphy by the workshops of stonecutters and mosaicists, and that only a thorough study of workshops can provide us with a complete understanding of the processes underpinning this same transition. So far, epigraphists of the Roman period have had few instruments to draw upon for the purposes of pursuing synthetic workshop studies, and have been overwhelmingly captivated by other strands: the quantitative research, the study of the self-representation, the visibility of inscriptions, and the \"\"viewers' culture\"\". The PI maintains that a significant leap in our understanding is, however, attainable through the building of a highly regionalized network\/stemma of workshops, which will identify workshops of origin for all the inscriptions from the 3rd-5th c., and through applying the methodologies of workshop studies developed for other craftsmanships and periods (in particular for early Greek vase painters, and for scribes and scriptoria) which the PI will adapt to the needs of the Graeco-Roman epigraphy. Assuming that these new methodological lenses will redefine the field and re-focus our attention on the actual actors behind the production of epigraphy - artisans and workshops - as primary agents of top-to-bottom cultural transfer, then we can anticipate an entire restructuring of our understanding of the way artisans disseminated elitist culture in the lower echelons of society.\"","for_first_level_name":"History and Archaeology","mesh_terms":["History, 19th Century","History, 20th Century","History, Ancient","Humans"]}

{"title":"NHS my-care","abstract":"This is a joint proposal by Coventry and City Universities. It arose out of the EPSRC sandpit on Mobile and Distributed Healthcare, and specifically addresses the issue of how medical services may be delivered to the patient in a more timely, safe and effective manner.The concept of patient held health care records is not a new one. It is recognized that medical and health care professionals and the public may derive benefits from a system which enables some medical records to be kept with and updated by the patient, or potential patient. Such information may relate to life long illness and disability (such as diabetes, asthma or autism) or current drug regimes. Where records are kept with the patient, in cases of sudden illness or accident, paramedics can identify the patient, gain a picture of chronic and acute conditions, ascertain where any complications may arise, and contact the immediate family. This increases the quality of service in terms of both the efficiency and safety of the treatment.The development of such a system depends on :1) the acceptance of the concept within the medical profession and the public, 2) a secure, safe, robust and easy to technology 3) the design of an appropriate means of carrying and updating patient held health records4) the technological infrastructure at a regional, national and international level.This project will address the first three of these issues in the following ways. An attitudinal survey will be undertaken of all stakeholders to ascertain current levels of support or otherwise for such a system, in terms of perceived costs and benefits. The findings from this will be used to raise awareness and debate about patient held health records and will also provide information about the type of system that may be acceptable (for example in terms of design, information content and means of entering and updating the information). This will lead to a series of concept, working prototypes which will be used to disseminate the ideas in roadshows across the UK \/ thereby gaining more insight into people's reactions to this.

{"title":"Reconciling Post-Election Auditing with the Secret Ballot","abstract":"A fundamental tension exists between transparency and privacy in electronic voting. Electoral transparency requires access to primary voter records, so observers can be sure that the election was run appropriately. Ballot privacy---keeping ballot contents separate from information that can identify the voter---is required to prevent coercion and vote-selling. If we discard either transparency or privacy, voting becomes much simpler: without transparency, ballots can be perfectly private; with no privacy requirement, elections can be perfectly transparent. The project aims to reconcile transparency with ballot privacy in electronic voting systems. The project has several goals. The project is identifying legal and technical barriers to increased privacy, both in terms of fundamental limits and limits imposed by technology. The project is also identifying vulnerabilities enabled by the movement for increased electoral transparency, for example the practical risks of identifying ballots using voter marks and paper-fingerprinting. This enables research to design privacy-preserving methods for publishing artifacts of transparency, such as scanned ballot images. The project is examining the loss of ballot privacy intrinsic to various models of post-election audits, where the trend has been toward greater disclosure of records, which may implicate issues of ballot privacy. The project is creating process models of post-election audits to identify and compare ballot privacy leakage and developing methods to better determine how many ballots are truly in an audit batch, a crucial but overlooked element of the mathematics in post-election audits.","for_first_level_name":"Information and Computing Sciences","mesh_terms":["Disclosure","Privacy"]}

{"title":"Open and physically secure cryptographic implementations: theory and practice.","abstract":"Cryptographic implementations are traditionally evaluated based on a trade-off between security and efficiency. However, when it comes to physical security against attacks exploiting side-channel leakages or fault insertions, this approach is limited by the difficulty to define the adversaries (e.g., their knowledge about the target implementation) and to specify sound physical assumptions. Quite naturally, the problem becomes even more challenging in contexts where implementations can be maliciously modified during design or fabrication via so-called hardware Trojans. To a large extent, these vulnerabilities echo the general challenge of restoring trust that is faced by cryptographic research in view of the recent Snowden revelations. In this context, we believe that the design of small components able to perform secure computations locally will be an important building block of future information systems. For this purpose, we envision a paradigm shift in embedded security, by adding trust as an essential element in the evaluation of physically secure objects. Our two main ingredients to reach this ambitious goal are a good separation between mathematics and physics, and improved transparency in security evaluations. That is, we want cryptographic implementations to rely on physical assumptions that can be empirically verified, in order to obtain sound security guarantees based on mathematical proofs or arguments. And we want to make the empirical verification of physical assumptions more transparent, by considering open source hardware and software. By allowing adversaries and evaluators to know implementation details, we expect to enable a better understanding of the fundamentals of physical security, therefore leading to improved security, efficiency and trust in the longer term. That is, we hope to establish security guarantees based on a good understanding of the physics, rather than the (relative) misunderstanding caused by closed systems.","for_first_level_name":"Information and Computing Sciences","mesh_terms":["Computer Security","Models, Theoretical","Security Measures","Software"]}
{"title":"Building Web Services Infrastructure for Senior Citizens","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The healthcare needs of senior citizens are expected to surge as baby-boomers start retiring. As a result, this trend will put tremendous stress on the already stretched and cost spiraling healthcare systems. Of special interest in this project is senior citizens healthcare. Senior citizens are challenged in ways fundamentally different from the general population. Receiving services in a convenient way is not a matter of choice for them, but of necessity. Failing health accompanied with limited mobility may force senior citizens into unhealthy choices. Recent advances in Web standards and technologies offer a cost effective leverage to maintain and use large healthcare information systems. New studies suggest that senior citizens are now the fastest growing group of World Wide Web users. This pilot project, a collaborative effort between Virginia Tech and the Virginia Department for the Aging (VDA), focuses on the development of a Web service middleware infrastructure. The infrastructure will enable the seamless interoperation of the VDA's autonomous information systems based on new Web service standards. Web services are modular, XML-based software components that can be discovered, accessed, and composed using widely accepted industry standards. The proposed middleware will enable senior citizens to request and receive services using a one-stop shop interface. A graphical user interface that adapts to the limited abilities of senior citizens is proposed to be designed as a Web service providing a homogeneous design framework. The protection of senior citizens privacy is paramount. Agent-based techniques congruent with Web services are proposed to enforce privacy protection. The proposed pilot project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a Web service middleware for the purpose of providing convenient, effective, and customized services to senior citizens. Web services on the Web are poised to play the same role as data has played in database management systems. Two sites, Virginia Tech and VDA, will be used for the deployment of the Web Service middleware prototype. T he deliverable is the proof of concept. Three specific research issues w ill be investigated in this project: (1) dynamic Web service composition, and (2) privacy preservation, and (3) adaptive presentation.

{"title":"Aspects of lexicalization of multiword connections in the perspective of relational semantics","abstract":"The basic question of a linguist dealing with the description of lexis is what is a unit of language. It becomes all the more important and difficult when we analyze units consisting of more than one word. This problem is very well known to the authors and editors of monolingual dictionaries, who, before starting lexicographic works, must attempt to precisely define a multiword unit in order to select those word combinations that should be registered in the dictionaries. These word combinations, which function as single words in the language, are referred to in the literature by different names, including Phraseology, multi-word lexical unit, multi-segment unit, multi-word compound and many more. The sheer multiplicity of terms proves how complicated and ambiguous the phenomenon we are dealing with. In our study, we aim to describe the criteria for the lexicalization of multiword units, i.e. in other words, such features that make certain multiword language forms are considered lexicized (i.e. they are treated as units of the vocabulary of a language and end up in dictionaries), and others - no. Most people who speak Polish will admit with certainty that the white crow is one indivisible unit with a defined meaning and should be registered in dictionaries as a separate password. And, for example, the front door? Or the species name domestic dog? In our research, we will try to find differences between such similar-looking word combinations, focusing on noun and verb phrases as the most common and most often used (and also transformed) by language users. The work will be conducted simultaneously for Polish and English, as we assume that it is possible to develop to some extent common, language-independent criteria for assessing the lexicality of word combinations. In our study, we will use the latest methods of language exploration developed in the field of computational linguistics and natural language processing, consisting in the description of the structure of multiword units in the formal language, in order to quantify some features of these units based on large corpora of texts, e.g. the variability of the pattern (e.g. door entrance and entrance doors) or separability (e.g. insert your three pennies and throw in your three pennies into a conversation). For us, research based on corpora will become the basis for working on specific multiword connections, which are described in lexical-semantic networks (wordnets) for both languages. It should be noted that such a procedure exists for the Polish language and is used by the authors of the Polish wordnet (S\u0142owosieci), but it contains an extensive set of rules for one type of connection - a two-word connection, consisting of a noun and an adjective that defines it.

Previous studies on race and leisure take a historical or ethnographic perspective but do not consider media as a primary archival source and the cultural work of images in shaping our understanding of the relationship between African American identity formation, acts of resistance and leisure. Specifically, this research focuses on how media, such as advertisements, photographs, and home videos have been used to document and promote leisure practices as a form of covert resistance.

They began their careers by writing poems and seem to have proceeded to the fascist government, in the turbulent and contradictory society during the period from the late 19th nad the first half of the 20th century. In spite of these resemblance, however, their philosophies of life are incompatible with that of the fascist regime. We have extracted (1) the concept of the acquisition of life through allegiance to the death in D'Annunzio and (2) the concept of \"the death existing in the life in itself\". These are nothing but their mere literary conception and, as so, only apparently they can have an ephemeral affinity with the political ambition of the fascist leader. The significance of their literary works lies in the fact that they described various aspects of an anxious world based on their own view of life and death and that they were real and lively description of hopes and anxieties during the fascism era in Italy","for_first_level_name":"Language, Communication and Culture","mesh_terms":["History, 19th Century","History, 20th Century","Humans","Italy"]}

{"title":"Proof and Standard of Proof","abstract":"The evaluation of evidence is an issue which has an exceptionally great weight in judicial practice. This contrasts with a certain neglect of the topic in legal research and teaching. This may be related to the question of how reliable information can be obtained from insecure foundations, a question that can not be answered solely from a traditional legal point of view but requires an interdisciplinary approach. It may also be related to the fact that the judicial conviction according to the traditional conception \"is the product of a psychic process which is not accessible to any legal regulation\" (Guldener, Proofreading, 5). Swiss legal literature also stresses that the On the one hand, the evaluation of evidence is based, on the one hand, on intellectual thought operations and, on the other hand, on irrational, emotional processes (B\u00dcHLER, Kritikw\u00fcrdigung, 89). As far as the intellectual side of the evaluation of evidence is concerned, the ruling doctrine demands \"a duty of conscientious reasoning based on the result of the evidence procedure. The court must justify its opinion, it is not enough if it simply declares itself convinced \"(Guldener, Zivilprozessrecht, 322). Proof of evidence \"must not violate the laws of logic\" (HABSCHEID, Zivilprozessrecht, 398). As a first step, the proposed project will investigate which are the \"laws of logic\" that the judge must observe. In particular, it will be investigated whether the laws of probabilistic inference can be used for judicial evidence, and more specifically whether Bayesian networks (TARONI et al., Bayesian Networks) allow a rational appreciation of complex evidence While the first part of the work deals with rational methods of evaluating evidence in accordance with the \"laws of logic\", a second part will examine how the evidence is actually evaluated by courts, ie which is the \"psychic process\" that determines the evaluation of evidence. Here, on the one hand, we want to investigate whether \"dual process\" theories of human cognition can describe psychological processes of evaluating evidence. On the other hand, so-called \"holistic\" psychological theories of evidence evaluation will be examined, in particular the \"story model\" by PENNINGTON and HASTIE (PENNNINGTON \/ HASTIE, story model) and the \"coherence-based thinking\" (SIMON, Third view of the black box). , The aim is to identify legal framework conditions that support the evaluation of evidence that satisfies the claim of the prevailing doctrine and jurisprudence that the evaluation of evidence may not contradict the laws of logic. In a final section it will be examined which of the \"optimal\" proofs in Civil matters is. Evaluation of evidence and proof can hardly be considered separately. This is not surprising, since the evidence is the process that leads to judicial conviction. What the conviction must relate to - whether the alleged fact is true or to some extent likely - is the question governed by the proof. In Switzerland, the discussion about which rule-proofing measure is required in civil cases has not been discussed in depth. Because a determination of the claim-substantive facts can not be demanded with absolute certainty, it can only be a matter of distributing the unavoidable error risk when determining the proof. In the context of the research project, it will be examined here in particular which rules the static decision theory makes about the distribution of the risk of error, and whether these rules can also be used for the proof in civil law.","for_first_level_name":"Law and Legal Studies","mesh_terms":["Bayes Theorem","Expert Testimony","Humans"]}

{"title":"International law and international reputation in Brazil","abstract":"The responsibility for maintaining a state's international legal reputation ultimately rests with the elite actors who make decisions about state behavior. These actors make decisions, however, in the context of mass public opinion about how the state should act.  Although not the sole driver of geopolitical decisions, the sense that citizens have of whether or not their state should comply with international law has purchase on the calculations of political decision makers, and the instinct to preserve national reputation is therefore partly motivated by mass public opinion.Reputational concerns may be particularly relevant for rising international powers like Brazil. As Brazil takes on increased regional and global responsibility, its reputation becomes an increasingly valuable commodity.  Placed in a position where Brazil may be seeking to make international law - through bilateral, regional or global treaties - the country's existing reputation can either facilitate or hinder its ability to play a leadership role in global affairs.  To what extent are the dynamics implicit in the reputational theory of international law at work in Brazil?  In this project, we seek to better understand mass public opinion in Brazil with regard to international law.  In particular, we seek to see if Brazilian citizens perceive differential costs to the violation of international law depending on the manner in which the law was created and Brazil's level of participation in the creation of the law. Our results will provide general evidence with regard to the role of mass public opinion in the reputational theory of international law and specific evidence about Brazilian citizens' sense of the risks to their national reputation from violating international law.  The results will help us to better situate Brazil as a regional and global player that is taking an increasingly prominent role on the international stage. We expect to identify the greatest perceived risk to reputation among our respondents when Brazil is considering violating non-consensus-based international law that it has helped to design.  The second greatest reputational risk comes from violating traditional, consensus-based international law. To better understand how Brazilians react to international legal commitments, we propose to use an experiment embedded in a representative public opinion survey. Each of our survey respondents will hear one of four randomly selected vignettes about a costly international legal obligation faced by Brazil.  In the control condition, we will not make any reference to the way in which the international law was created.

{"title":"MH LAW: CLINICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES FOR CLINICIANS","abstract":"The goal of this grant proposal is to develop a very practical handbook for all types of mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, as well as mental health aides, describing how the law interfaces with their clinical decision-making. Since mental health is the most heavily regulated aspect of health care this is particularly relevant. The proposed book Mental Health Law-Clinical and Legal Issues for the Practitioner will upon completion be published in inexpensive form, with a publisher who has made a commitment to advertise the book widely within the entire community of mental health care providers. The chapters of the book will address the major issues of concerns to the mental health professionals. The laws will be explained and this followed by an explanation of the clinical implications of the case and statutory law. A section of \"Commonly Asked Questions\" will demonstrate the practical approach to dealing with legal requirements in the clinical setting. Each chapter will provide an extensive clinical and legal bibliography which will be current through mid-1986. This has the advantage of providing a literature search, as well as exposure to the legal references, which are often critical in this area, yet overlooked by mental health professionals. The chapters will conclude with charts documenting the statutory law of each state, thus providing readers with the specifics of the legal requirements in their area. The statutory cite will be given, in the event the reader wishes to read the full eext of the statute. During the past 15 years there has been a revolution in the area of mental health law. This has caused many practitioners to have a heightened awareness of the law and its impact on their clinical practice.

{"title":"Morality and justice in genocide denial. If a prosecution of genocide denial justified?","abstract":"The project examines the moral and legal consequences of genocide as historical injustice. In particular, it examines whether and how a liberal state should respond to genocide denial. Should what is morally required be enforced by the means of law? In a transition to democracy, the past should be worked up and the victims of the pre-constitutional predecessor regime and their descendants given due respect. These demands are based on moral principles, especially those that are (again) to be restored according to historical injustice (historical) justice. An important aspect here is the recognition of victim status, the negation of which would mean a second injustice to the victims, since the (remembered) historical injustice is often an important element of the personal and social identity of the victims and the group of victims. The project examines the extent to which victims' claim to public recognition as victims is a moral claim and which legal claims can be derived and asserted. Does the moral claim to recognition of historical injustice be legal? Should the denial of scientifically proven historical injustice be sanctioned by means of (criminal) law? The criminalization of the denial of historical injustice leads to a conflict of values in a liberal constitutional state. It conflicts with the constitutionally protected fundamental right of freedom of expression. The question then arises as to how this conflict should be interpreted as well as whether and, if so, under what conditions the goods protected by the moral sanctioning of the denial of historical injustice should be given priority as legal interests. In summary, the purpose of the project is to identify the moral principles of dealing with historical injustices, to justify the moral condemnation, in particular, of genocide denunciation, and to determine whether and, if so, why, what legal and especially criminal consequences for liberal constitutional states to be drawn from it.","for_first_level_name":"Law and Legal Studies","mesh_terms":["Crime Victims","Humans","Morals","Social Justice"]}

This summer school features a distinguished collection of geometers and geometric group theorists who have been chosen both for their mathematical excellence and their outstanding expository skills. The summer school will attract talented early career mathematicians from around the world. The support from this project shall expose US-based graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors to a broad spectrum of topics in geometric group theory at an early stage of their career development and to foster intellectual relationships, both with the lecturers and with other graduate students, which will benefit the students throughout their careers. These relationships will have a long-term positive impact on the interactions between the mathematical communities in geometric group theory in the U.S. and Europe. The organizing committee and the principal investigators are committed to funding a diverse group of mathematicians. Geometric group theory is devoted to exploring connections between algebraic properties of groups and topological and geometric properties of the spaces on which they act. Geometric group theory closely interacts with low dimensional topology, hyperbolic geometry, Lie groups and homogeneous spaces, algebraic topology, computational group theory, and differential geometry. There are also substantial connections with complexity theory, mathematical logic, dynamical systems, probability theory, K-theory, and other areas of mathematics. Geometric group theory is a very broad area, and this project shall focus on geometrical aspects of group actions, for example, actions on trees, curve complexes, cube complexes, and discrete groups arising in geometry, topology and dynamics.

{"title":"Resonances in heteroclinic networks","abstract":"Symmetries (reflections, rotations, translations) play a prominent role in understanding the dynamics and evolution of many physical systems. One effect of symmetry is to permit the existence of invariant subspaces: if a system is started in a reflection-symmetric state, for example, it will keep that symmetry for all time (unless the symmetry is broken by imperfections or external noise). Much progress has been made in understanding of types of behaviour a physical system with symmetry might exhibit as it is driven by external forcing. The simplest types of behaviour, steady and time-periodic oscillatory, are well understood, and transitions between such states can be analysed using equivariant bifurcation theory. Intermittency is less well understood. Here, a system spends most of its time exhibiting one type of behaviour, but has occasional rapid excursions to another type.Intermittency can be associated with symmetry through the mechanism of structurally stable heteroclinic cycles, in which connections between equilibrium solutions of a dynamical system are robust because they occur within a symmetry-invariant subspace. Near a robust heteroclinic cycle, the dynamics is typically intermittent: the system spends some time near one equilibrium point, jumps rapidly to a second equilibrium point and stays there for a longer time, continuing around the cycle before returning to the original equilibrium point and spending longer still there. If the cycle is attracting, the residence times close to each equilibrium point increase geometrically without bound, resulting in systems that are at once highly intermittent and difficult to follow numerically.In many important examples, heteroclinic cycles occur as part of a larger heteroclinic network, in which two or more distinct cycles have some common equilibria (or other solutions) and connections, so that orbits passing near the common parts of the network may switch between excursions around the different cycles in the network. Some general results are known about the stability of heteroclinic cycles, and one of the more interesting ways a cycle can change stability is through a resonant bifurcation.However, little is yet known about resonant bifurcations in the context of heteroclinic networks. Important questions include: What happens when a network as a whole becomes unstable? Is it possible to define resonance for a network, and if so what dynamics is associated with this phenomenon? Is something different seen if just one cycle within a network has a resonance bifurcation? These are all interesting questions about which little is understood.One of the main obstructions to a good understanding of resonance phenomena in the context of a heteroclinic network is that at least one element of the heteroclinic network must have an unstable manifold of dimension greater than one, and this greatly complicates the usual method of analysis. We propose to examine a variety of heteroclinic networks, both numerically and via analytical techniques, aiming to understand what kind of dynamics is associated with resonant bifurcations. We will also investigate how trajectories switch between different parts of the network, and how switching is influenced by noise and by forced symmetry breaking.","for_first_level_name":"Mathematical Sciences","mesh_terms":["Algorithms","Models, Biological","Models, Theoretical","Time Factors"]}

However, the practical implementation of such applicability is often hindered by ingrained incorrect traditions, misdirected scholarship and operational difficulties. In recent years, the growth of science in Brazil, and mathematics in particular, has been remarkable. However, the application of technology, often measured by patents, has not had the same success. To close this gap it is necessary to create institutional structures to establish bridges between the mathematical sciences and applications as a goal in itself. It is not just to guide the theoretical work to areas \"potentially relevant\" but to take applications to the last consequences, i.e., its effective implementation in the industry at large. One can no longer say that the application can be left to someone else. It is, in fact, a problem concerning all the community and reflects the necessary commitment of pure and applied science with the material and spiritual progress of society. The strategy of this project involves, first, the clustering of imp01iant groups in the areas of applied mathematics at the State of S\u00e3o Paulo and directing their work towards effective applications. The selected groups have demonstrated excellence in the scientific standard in the first place and in many cases, also in relevant applications. In the proposed CEPID participating groups will continue with their usual scientific activities, and at the same time, develop \"technology transfer activities\" according to the following: 1) master's and doctoral theses necessarily linked with applications in a broad sense, with co-supervision from experts in the applications sectors; 2) conduct at least an annual Transfer Workshop, with participating members of CEPID and representatives of industry, administration, services, educational and technological sectors; 3) regular visits by members of CEPID to institutions with potential for significant applications; 4) development of an online publication called in principle \"Technology Transference Experiences\" aiming at the consolidation of a more permanent publication.

{"title":"Bootstrap and model selection for stochastic chains with memory of variable length","abstract":"Resampling methods have been used with success in the practical implementation of statistical tools. Recently, non asymptotic results have been obtained theoretically, in particular in modelselection, leading to great improvements of the practical procedures. We propose to study rigorously some resampling methods for chains with memory of variable length. These chains,introduced by Rissanen in 1983, have been intensively studied since then. This is due not only to the mathematical interest of this new class of processes, but also to its possibilities as models for scientific data coming from domains as different as biology and linguistics. From a statistical point of view, given a sample the basic question is to retrieve the smallest contexttree associate to a chain with memory of variable length which best fits the sample. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this goal, but they all depend on unknown constants or onunknown properties of the estimator. Resampling methods seems particularly suitable to handle this kind of difficulty.Besides its intrinsic interest as a theoretical statistics project, this proposal has also an interdisciplinary and applied aspect, motivated by the linguistic challenge of retrieving rhythmicfeatures from a written text. Preliminary studies strongly suggests that context trees are good candidates as signatures of the rhythmic classes whose existence has been conjectured in thelinguistics literature. The practical goal of this project is to apply the new theoretical results obtained as tools to analyse linguistic samples, trying to obtain new evidences, with arigorous statistical methodology, supporting the linguistic conjecture of the existence of rhythmic classes of languages.

The detection results, however, depends on manual analysis, which results to inefficiency. Recently, statistical analysis was proposed for several materials testing, but still suffers from large computational requirement and lack of physical meaning.To overcome these issues, this project develops a new special statistical analysis method, which is built through carefully considering the character of ECPT transient response. This method 1) is developed from independent component analysis, and employs the link between infrared camera pixel and area under detection. This means the statistical analysis closely links to the physical model. 2) Constrains the iterative process using the character of transient response,and replaces the full data space with local sample data to cut the calculated amount. The success of this project can not only significantly improve the efficency of ECPT , but also provid theory and data support for quantitative evaluation.

{"title":"HIV-1 host cell factors: a saturation screen for human chromosomes 4, 6, 21 and X","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 host cell factors: a saturation screen for human chromosomes 4, 6, 21 and X. There is intense interest in identifying cellular host cell factors that modulate the life cycle of HIV-1. These factors can be classified as restriction factors that inhibit infection and permissive factors that aid the infection process. The study of these factors will aid in our understanding of viral and host cell interactions and to identify novel cellular drug targets. Since present drug therapies are based on targeting viral proteins, and the high mutation rate of HIV is able to generate resistance to these antiviral drugs, cellular proteins may constitute targets in which resistance is harder to generate. Various strategies to identify these proteins have been used. Here we propose an approach for the identification of host cell factors for the early life cycle of HIV. We aim to do a saturating insertional mutagenesis screen that will sample 1\/5 of the human genome for host cell factor genes. We will achieve this aim using cells that have monosomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 21 and X. We will develop an insertional vector that disrupts gene function and select cells infected with this mutagenic vector for resistance to HIV-1 infection using an HIV-1 vector that is toxic on infection. Insertions into chromosome 4, 6, 21 and X will be identified through sequencing of DNA flanking the mutagenic vector. At the conclusion of this study we will have at least 2-3 verified host cell factors and the point in the lifecycle at which they are utilized. We will also have in hand a valuable resource - a knockout cell line of the host cell factor. This will enable structure-function relationships of the protein and the virus in future studies. These host cell factors may constitute novel targets for small drug molecules to combat HIV-1 and AIDS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-1 host cell factors: a saturation screen for human chromosomes 4, 6, 21 and X. HIV-1 relies on host cell proteins to complete its replication cycle. Identification of these factors is important since they are potential targets for the development of drugs to combat HIV-1 infection. In this study we aim to interrogate 1\/5 the human genome in a pilot study to discover some host cell factors required by HIV-1 for infection.","for_first_level_name":"Medical and Health Sciences","mesh_terms":["HIV Infections","HIV-1","Humans","Mutagenesis, Insertional"]}
{"title":"Development of Real-Time Optical Coherence Elastography System to Quantify the Mechanical Properties of Retinal Layers In-vivo","abstract":"Project Summary Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness among elderly people in the United States. Standard methods of diagnosis and progression tracking are fundus camera imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Using these modalities, the anatomical changes of the retina during the onset of AMD have been widely studied. However, during the early stages of the disease, it is difficult to detect subtle anatomical differences with high accuracy, leading to prolonged diagnosis and disease management. It has been recently understood that there is a correlation between the mechanical properties of the retinal tissues and the early on-set of AMD, which can aid in the diagnosis of early stage diseases. However, the retina, which is a thin membrane at the very back of the eye, is often inaccessible to mechanical testing methods and most functional imaging methods do not meet the requirements for high resolution. Therefore, there is a strong need for a minimally invasive, high resolution, and safe imaging technology that is able to diagnose and track the disease during its first stages so that early management is possible. Acoustic radiation force optical coherence elastography (ARF-OCE) is an ideal candidate for retinal imaging because of its high-resolution, high speed, and high sensitivity to both axial and lateral mechanical contrast. It uses an ultrasound transducer to generate acoustic force on the sample, which causes vibrations that are detected by OCT. This technique has been shown to work well in ex- vivo cornea and retina studies. However, in order to translate this idea to in-vivo animal studies, and eventually to clinical trials, it is necessary to address a few limitations of the current system: low sub- millimeter imaging region, instability of moving parts causing slow imaging speed, and complexity of image reconstruction. To overcome these limitations, the primary goal of this proposal is to develop an ocular elastography system using 2 unfocused moduluated ultrasound transducers. The proposed set-up will be able to obtain 3-D elastograms of a 1 cm2 region of the retina in less than 5 seconds, and requires no moving stages and image fusion. The transducer force region will be characterized using a hydrophone and through phantom studies. The elasticity of the retinal layers will be quantified by correlating the results from a frequency sweep to the resonance frequency of the sample, which has been proven to be related to the Young\u2019s modulus. Finally, rabbit AMD models will be used to perform in-vivo experiments and track the onset of AMD over a 12-week period. The imaging results will be compared to histology. The proposed system will have high-resolution, fast imaging speeds, and fast image analysis, and offer physicians more information about the onset and progression of AMD in order to obtain a more accurate understanding of the disease. This new technology is expected to have a significant impact to early diagnosis and management of AMD.","for_first_level_name":"Medical and Health Sciences","mesh_terms":["Elasticity Imaging Techniques","Humans","Macular Degeneration","Phantoms, Imaging","Retina","Tomography, Optical Coherence"]}
{"title":"A community based primary prevention programme for Type 2 Diabetes integrating identification, lifestyle intervention and community services for prevention.","abstract":"T2DM is an increasing chronic disease affecting over 2 million people in England alone, shortens life and consumes 10% of NHS resources. At diagnosis many have established complications involving damage to the eyes, kidneys, feet and heart. There is a need to focus efforts to prevent this devastating disease. One in 7 adults have Pre-diabetes (PDM) with 50% developing T2DM over the next 5-10 years. Despite clear evidence that treating subjects with PDM with an intensive lifestyle modification programme (LSMP) dramatically reduces T2DM, these programmes are not cost effective, involve intensive use of resources and are unproven in the UK. Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of T2DM, so any LSMP would need to be culturally sensitive. Our objective is to test if we can develop a low cost but effective LSMP for the UK. We will develop a training programme to skill healthcare professionals and non-professionals and \u2018lay\u2019 educators to deliver the LSMP. Benefits of lay educators are patient involvement in a patient centred service and the contribution to building capacity within the NHS workforce. We will develop a simple self-assessment tool to identify those at highest risk of T2DM. We will conduct a clinical trial, testing the LSMP in 50 practices and 816 patients. The practices will be randomised to either a control or intervention 'arm'. Control practices will give information to patients at risk in line with current best practice. Subjects in the Intervention practices will be invited to the LSMP to receive 7 hours of group education over 3 months plus ongoing contact. Subjects will be followed for 3 years. The LSMP will encourage individuals to scrutinise information, ask questions, and self-manage their condition, using simple, non-technical language and visual aids. This approach has been effective in T2DM and we will use this model along with expertise in physical activity and lifestyle change, working with leading experts. The study is designed to show if we can significantly reduce the risk of developing T2DM, as well as the effect on weight, blood pressure, patients' quality of life, physical activity and dietary behaviours. We will demonstrate its cost effectiveness to ensure relevance to the NHS. The research team have international expertise in prevention of T2DM. We believe our proposal represents excellent value for money and the costs are justified in terms of the scale and scope of the research programme planned.","for_first_level_name":"Medical and Health Sciences","mesh_terms":["Cost-Benefit Analysis","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","England","Humans","Patient Education as Topic","Quality of Life","State Medicine"]}

{"title":"Two-dimensional neural processing of auditory information in mammalian auditory cortex","abstract":"We studied 2-dimensional activities of auditory cortex in guinea pigs and rats using a 4x 4 channel microelectrode-array technique and an optical recording method with a 12 x 12 channel photodiode array. The aim of this study was to examine how the auditory cortex processes auditory information in a two-dimensional way along the cortex. The animals were anesthetized with Nembutal (30 mg\/kg) and neuroleptanalgesia (droperidole 16.7 mg\/kg\/h and pentazocine 5 mg\/kg\/h). For optical recording, the auditory cortex was stained with a voltage sensitive dye RH795 (styryl dye, Molecular Probes, Inc.). Color-coded spatiotemporal response patterns were displayd on a monitor screen. Sound stimuli used were pure tone bursts, frequency modulated (FM) sounds and vocalizations of the animals. They were presented to the ear contralateral to the recording side.Tonotopical representation of the auditory cortex in guinea pigs and rats was confirmed by the present study using these 2-dimensional recording systems. We found newly that this tonotopical representation through the functional organization of the cortex is only transient and it varies with time. The neural activity in the guinea pig auditory cortex usually initiates ventrally and it propagates toward dorsally along the cortical surface. The moving direction is parallel to the isofrequency band. For FM sound stimulation, the neural activity propagates obliquely across the isofrequency bands. When a direction of FM sweep is reversed, the direction of propagation is reversed in the frequency axis, but not in the dorsocaudal axis. By applying bicuculline, a GABA_A antagonist, to the auditory cortex, we found strong GABAergic inhibition between isofrequency bands. However, cross-correlation analysis between action potentials of neuron pairs recorded by the microelectrode-array revealed that neurons located in about 0.5 mm separation along the cortical surface rarely showed neural correlations. Vocalization-specific responses were not found in the present study. These results indicate that parameters of sounds are represented in a 2-dimensional way along the auditory cortex, and that the auditory information was transformed into places within the auditory cortex.","for_first_level_name":"Medical and Health Sciences","mesh_terms":["Acoustic Stimulation","Action Potentials","Animals","Auditory Cortex","Evoked Potentials, Auditory","Guinea Pigs","Male","Microelectrodes","Neurons"]}
{"title":"THE RELIGIOUS SOUND AND THE PROHIBITION OF MUSIC:the case of the pre-Tridentine reforms of regular canons","abstract":"The prohibitions of music are often described as simple cultural conservatism or aural iconoclasm. However, they rely on complex issues which understanding could shed a light on the function of music \u2013 and more widely of sound \u2013 within a religious practice (either liturgical or devotional). Indeed, by producing a distinction, a prohibition makes it both possible to define an \u201caural idiom\u201d that can be locally interpreted as properly religious, and to identify the subjected social community. Thus, the study of music prohibitions goes much further the single observation of moral or esthetical behaviors. It makes it possible to understand the religious value of musical and aural practices, that is the conditions that allow them to recover a sense within the system they belong to \u2013 and thus to be effective.  In order to understand how a musical prohibition intervenes in the construction of a religious \u201caural idiom\u201d, in the guidance and control of individuals, or in the definition of communities, this research project will take advantage of the documentation produced by the congregations of Windesheim, Lateran and San Salvatore before the Tridentine Reforms. More precisely, it will focus on the sources that transmit the regulatory prescriptions (capitular acts), the moral yearnings (behavior manuals) and their local implementations (music manuscripts, chronicles and account books). Confronting diachronically the convergences or divergences between these three documentary levels, it aims to understand how the participation, the acceptance, the refusal or the bypassing of a prohibition by a given social group can act on the religious value of music or sound.","for_first_level_name":"Philosophy and Religious Studies","mesh_terms":["Humans","Morals","Music","Religion","Religion and Psychology"]}

{"title":"Constructing Objective Biological Criteria of Health","abstract":"The consensus in contemporary philosophy is that health is a normative concept derived from social values, not a biological feature of organisms. We disagree. This project will produce a new and transformative account of health driven by our best current biology. The project addresses two Big Questions. First, what is an organism and what is the telos (goal) towards which an organism is structured? Theories of the organism have a long and distinguished history in philosophy, from Aristotle through Kant to early 20th century philosophy of biology and medicine. We argue that a philosophy of health must rest on a theory of the organism, which in turn should be based on the fundamental organising theory of the life sciences, the theory of evolution. Our second Big Question is whether there is a factual distinction between the Normal and the Pathological. Contrary to the current consensus we argue that describing the structure and function of a living organism necessarily draws distinctions between normal and pathological. Moreover, recent developments in biology provide biological reasons for changing our ideas about which phenotypes are healthy and which pathological. This is because new discoveries about the nature of organisms and their goals affect our theory of the organism.

{"title":"Knowledge and God","abstract":"Many religious traditions speak of \"knowing God.\" Within certain strands of Christianity there is talk of knowing God in something like the way we know other people. But philosophers and theologians rarely make explicit exactly what this knowing amounts to, or how it might be achieved.\nRecent work in philosophy has begun to look more carefully at what constitutes knowing other persons, including work by philosophers of mind on second-personal thought (how our concepts and language enable us to think about another subject as a particular \"you\"), and by epistemologists on what sort of knowledge this might be and whether it is properly called \"knowledge.\" This research has close connections to empirical work in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience on what it is to perceive and recognize persons and personality. My own work develops the epistemology of \"interpersonal knowledge,\" and clarifies its relations to knowledge of facts about someone. For we can, on the one hand, come to know a lot of facts about someone without ever thereby coming to know them personally; and on the other hand, we can know someone personally while nevertheless believing a great many falsehoods about them. This account yields important results for how to think about knowing God. Such results advance several debates in philosophy of religion and analytic theology, including on the problems of divine hiddenness and the problem of evil, the epistemology of religious liturgy, the nature of divine love, and epistemic injustice in our responses to religious testimony. Such applications also offer a unique perspective on problems of religious disagreement, and on the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.\nI aim to write four to six more scholarly articles on these topics over the next three years, intended for publication in reputable philosophy journals or peer-reviewed edited volumes. Once published, these will lay the groundwork for an eventual scholarly book.","for_first_level_name":"Philosophy and Religious Studies","mesh_terms":["Humans","Knowledge","Philosophy","Religion","Religion and Psychology"]}
{"title":"Time, Freedom, and Physics:  reconciling immanent and transcendent views","abstract":"As our scientific knowledge has grown in both depth and scope, it has  supplanted both philosophy and religion in many parts of our culture as a source of world-view.   But science confronts us with a vision of ourselves and our own place in the Cosmos that challenges our ideas about who we are. Many people have claimed that it tells us that free will is a pre-scientific fantasy and that the passage of time is an illusion. These claims are so directly at odds with our experience that they call into question whether the lessons of the science have been properly understood. They must be addressed if science is really to provide us with a world-view.\nThe reason that people make these claims is rooted in the fault-line between a view of the cosmos from outside of space and time and a view through the eyes of an  agent whose actions are part of the causal fabric of the universe. This is a fault-line that runs through science as well, and expresses itself in a collection of controversies in contemporary cosmology.\nMy project focuses in on that fault-line.  It looks at immanent and transcendent approaches to time, freedom, and physics. On the philosophical side, I want to bring new insight into how the two views- the immanent view and the transcendent view -are reconciled, and show how to recover the proper understanding of ourselves as agents in a universe of the kind that cosmology describes in transcendent terms.  I will write three  papers that will be presented as the Burman lectures in Sweden, and prepared in longer form for publication. On the scientific side, I will write two papers addressing scientific controversies associated with the relationship between immanent and transcendent approaches to physics.  All of this work will lay the foundation for a book of my own that I hope will lay out a new way of seeing what science tells us about our place in the Cosmos, from both an immanent and transcendent perspective.","for_first_level_name":"Philosophy and Religious Studies","mesh_terms":["Humans","Philosophy","Physics","Science"]}

{"title":"Research on Detection Technology of Large-diameter Optical Components of Laser Driver Based on PIE","abstract":"In constructing and upgrading the \u2018SG\u2019 high power laser facilities of China, there is no ideal technique available now to realize the accurate online and offline measurement of the large optical elements, which have the diameter up to half meter and the weight of hundreds pounds. To some degree, this has become a big barrier for the performance improvement of these facilities and has hindered the progress of the ICF related research. To resolve this problem, a new kind of technique is proposed in this proposal for the large optical element measurement by studying and modifying the newly developed PIE (Ptychographical Iterative Engine)imaging method. Completely different from all the traditional techniques, this proposed method reconstructs the complex transmission function of the optical elements without using the interferometric setup, the standard mirror, the micro-lens array and other high quality optics, and accordingly it has the advantages of small size, light weight, simple structure, high accuracy and wide applicability. At the same time, since its requirement on the stability of the working environment is quite low, it is much suitable for the online measurement of the optical elements of the laser driver. Internationally, this is the first time for PIE to be studied as an optical metrology technique, and its success will directly improve the performance of our 'SG' laser drivers.","for_first_level_name":"Physical Sciences","mesh_terms":["China","Lasers","Optics and Photonics"]}

{"title":"Modelling the formation of cosmic structure","abstract":"Understanding the formation of cosmic structure, from the first stars at early epochs to the rich array of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the nearby universe, drives many aspects of contemporary astronomy. Recent observations of the relic microwave radiation from early in the universe tightly constrain the form of the tiny initial density fluctuations out of which these structures grew. My research focusses on the critical numerical models of cosmic evolution that connect these initial cosmic ripples with presently observed cosmic populations. Despite simple governing physics, the huge range of scales present and complex gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions means that detailed predictions require the indispensable experimental laboratory provided by numerical simulation.\n    A key requirement for producing useful and accurate models of cosmic structure is the ability to undertake very high resolution simulations. I have been involved in many leading large-scale cosmological simulations and in the development of highly optimized numerical algorithms and now, with the recent installation of powerful supercomputers in Ontario, have the ability to undertake some of the most ambitious studies of cosmic structure to date.\n    I am focussing on two specific aspects of structure formation: the formation of the first objects at early epochs and the formation and evolution of galaxies. The first objects and early stages of galaxy formation will over the next decade finally become accessible to new instruments and it is vital to provide detailed theoretical support to anticipate these observational programmes. The first objects set the stage for the formation of galaxies - the ``Holy Grail'' of cosmic structure studies. The group at McMaster has recently made significant progress in developing models of dwarf galaxies that incorporate realistic models for star formation and feedback that have resolved a key puzzle of the standard cosmic model. The challenge is now to understand the development of more massive galaxies and to chart the full history of comsic structure.","for_first_level_name":"Physical Sciences","mesh_terms":["Algorithms","Animals","Biological Evolution","Computer Simulation","Models, Biological","Models, Theoretical"]}

{"title":"Decoding imagined vowel productions using electroencephalography","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most important applications for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) is in individuals who are almost completely paralyzed but whose cortical processes are intact, such as patients with Locked-in Syndrome. For these people, communication can be laborious if not impossible without the aid of a BCI. Most current non-invasive communication BCIs use an indirect approach involving neural signals unrelated to speech to accomplish spelling or typing tasks. However, recent research into direct speech BCIs holds the promise of faster communication speeds because the decoding algorithms utilize neural activity related to more natural communication, thus reducing the burden of effort for the user. This study will take the first steps towards developing an electroencephalography (EEG) based direct real-time speech BCI to restore communication to severely impaired patients. Specifically, this study will develop the ability to detect when a user is attempting to operate the BCI device or is at rest and the ability to decode differences in EEG patterns of activity between imagined vowels. This will involve (1) developing and optimizing analytical methods to decode EEG signals resulting from imagined movements in a cued paradigm, (2) benchmarking the analytical methods against current methods in the field by applying them to well known imagined hand movement paradigms, (3) applying the analytical methods to speech-related movements (imagined vowel productions), and (4) extending the analytical methods to decode signals collected in a self-paced paradigm. In order to achieve these aims, this study will record EEG from healthy and paralyzed participants while at rest or imagining a hand movement or vowel production in response to a cue. Two primary features will be used to decode the EEG signals: (1) the amplitude of the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) in the mu, beta, and gamma bands, and (2) the amplitude of the signal transformed using the first and last two Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) associated with the different experimental conditions. A number of classifiers will be applied to the data offline to decode imagined movements from each other and from rest. Classifier performance will be determined through cross-validation. Once the classifiers have been trained on the cued paradigm, they will be applied offline to a self-paced paradigm in which participants are given a fixed amount of time to imagine repeating a movement a given number of times. The classifiers will be judged based on how well they can predict the number of times each movement was repeated. The same analytical methods and experimental paradigms will be applied to both imagined hand movements (left or right fist clenching vs. rest) and to imagined vowel productions (\/a\/ or \/u\/ vs. rest). In a preliminary study in which one participant performed the cued paradigm, a 31-parameter logistic regression classifier was able to classify right vs. rest, left vs. rest, right vs. left, \/a\/ vs. rest, \/u\/ vs. rest, and \/a\/ vs. \/u\/ at levels above chance for the testing data, illustrating the feasibility of the proposed research.","for_first_level_name":"Psychology and Cognitive Sciences","mesh_terms":["Adult","Algorithms","Brain-Computer Interfaces","Electroencephalography","Humans","Male","Movement","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Speech","Young Adult"]}

Use of the CPT has led to numerous critical advances in our understanding of children's pain. Lab-based methods, such as the CPT, are particularly valuable because they provide greater control over the environment, allowing researchers to investigate important research questions that cannot be adequately addressed in a clinical setting. Although the CPT is thought to produce pain similar to that of a medical procedure such as a needle, the extent to which this lab-based task produces a similar experience to clinical pain has surprisingly never been tested. To address this knowledge gap, the proposed study will examine the extent to which pain experienced by a child during a lab-based CPT corresponds to their pain experiences during a Hepatitis B immunization received during a school-based clinic. It will also determine whether child characteristics known to negatively impact pain experience (e.g., sex, anxiety, medical fears, previous pain experiences, coping style) have a similar impact on pain in both contexts. One hundred children (50% boys) aged 12-14 years will be video-recorded completing the CPT and the immunization. Children will report on the intensity, unpleasantness, and quality of their pain. Behavioural and physiological indicators of pain will also be obtained.

{"title":"Relapse-suppressing brain mechanisms in alcoholism: role of the mPFC","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol dependence is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive alcohol use. Significant effort has been dedicated to reveal neurobehavioral factors responsible for promoting relapse. Despite such effort, effective interventions to prevent alcohol relapse have yet to be established. An alternative research strategy may thus prove beneficial. For this premise, an \"omission cue-induced suppression (OCIS) paradigm\" was developed to investigate the relapse-suppressing potential of cues that signal alcohol omission (unavailability). Preliminary results indicate that omission cues suppress alcohol seeking triggered by all major modes of relapse-promotion: alcohol cues, stress and alcohol itself. Remarkably, omission cues suppress alcohol seeking in alcohol dependent subjections undergoing acute or protracted withdrawal - conditions linked to high risk of relapse. Additional preliminary results indicate that OCIS is controlled by 1) a discrete subpopulation of omission cue-activated neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) - a region implicated in cognitive control of drug craving in addicts. Given that the neural activation is a product of loca excitatory neurotransmission, OCIS is likely controlled by 2) omission cue-activated excitatory transmission in mPFC, as well as 3) omission cue-activated excitatory afferent innervations to mPFC - brain substrates known to provide the drive to induce neural activation in mPFC. Considering the above, this project will test the overarching hypothesis that OCIS of alcohol seeking is controlled by omission cue-activated excitatory neurotransmission and afferents driving distinct neural activation in mPFC. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will focus on omission cue-activated neurons in mPFC. Aim 2 will focus on omission cue-activated excitatory neurotransmission in mPFC. Aim 3 will focus on omission cue-activated excitatory afferent inputs to mPFC. Collectively, the expected results will establish brain mechanisms that actively suppress - rather than promote - alcohol relapse, and therefore present new insights for blocking relapse.","for_first_level_name":"Psychology and Cognitive Sciences","mesh_terms":["Alcoholism","Animals","Craving","Cues","Drug-Seeking Behavior","Prefrontal Cortex","Recurrence"]}

We conducted experiments using eye-tracking and a written recall task. The results suggest that learners can detect local inconsistencies during reading, whereas it is more difficult for learners to detect global inconsistencies. Furthermore, it was found that pre-reading instructions and post-reading tasks may affect learners\u2019 inconsistency detection. In the post-reading task, some readers substituted the textual information involving inconsistencies with more suitable (i.e., neutral) information.

Analyzing a selection of different research projects, the network seeks to theorize current scholarly media practices in the field of the so-called digital humanities. In order to analyze the epistemic, conceptual, and methodological conditions of digital film historiography, the network brings together theory with practice. It assumes that the challenges and potentials of digital tools can only be understood in its far-reaching dimensions when both applied and critically reflected. The network focuses less on digital cinema or new media but rather on filmhistoriographic data, digital methods, tools, and platforms which are used in the humanities. However, research outcomes and discourses on how we define and even produce historic sources play an important role, particularly when it comes to archiving and presentation practices.The network wishes to contribute to ongoing discussions about the relationship between the digital humanities and film and media studies. It seeks to advance research on the implications of digitalization for the humanities on an interdisciplinary level.

{"title":"Yesterday, today, tomorrow: a temporal spatial study of the zoning proposals in the municipality of Ourinhos and their implications for the graphic and visual reflection of the urban landscape","abstract":"In an etymological approach, the word zoning means ordering homogeneous areas to analyze the potential and vulnerabilities of a given territory. Associated with Urban Planning and Management, its objective gains other connotations. It becomes an important legal instrument for territorial ordering, directly contributing to the stages of urban planning. Firstly, because it allows the macrozoning of the municipality, through the elaboration of graphic scenarios (thematic mappings) from which it is possible to obtain the spatialization of the urban area, the trends of urban and rural expansions and special areas (environmental protection). And second, by enabling the rules of use and occupation for each of the macrozones. Associated with methodological foundations of graphic representation, zoning adds another function. It constitutes an important instrument of spatial representation that allows a dynamic approach, through the elaboration of graphic scenarios. Therefore, the spatio-temporal interpretation of a fact is possible: what was (past scenario), what is (real scenario) and possible trends (future trend scenario). In this regard, this research focuses on carrying out a memorial rescue of the Urban Zoning of the Municipality of Ourinhos-SP, based on cartographic documents (in deterioration) and concepts developed by Father Louis-Joseph Lebret, in the 1950s, which proposes a model of \"Economic-Humanistic Zoning\" for planning purposes. Thus, to restore cartographically (in digital media) the synthesis letter prepared by Lebret; confront methodologies (yesterday vs. today), through a comparative study between the zoning concept (Economic-Humanistic- 50s) with the current one (functional character of the new Master Plan); are the intended results for this research.

{"title":"Knowledge coproduction in climate services: European experiences and the Brazilian scenario evaluation","abstract":"In recent years, research on climate services has received considerable attention after the Global Framework for Climate Services\/World Meteorological Organization (GFCS\/WMO) implementation, which was established in the midst of international scientific discussions under the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In developed countries, the number of climate service providers in the public and private sectors has been increasing, in response to different demands at different spatial scales - local, national, regional and international. These services are developed with the purpose of subsidizing activities in different economical sectors (agriculture, transportation, energy etc.) as well as government areas for the implementation of weather and climate monitoring and warning systems, dedicated to disaster risk management (floods, mudslides, severe drought, hail showers, etc.). Despite the expansion of climate services, little is known about their effectiveness, how they are used in decision-making, or how institutional arrangements are structured and constituted for their full functioning, or even how they associate and fit into the formulation of public policy. It a similar way, climate services in Brazil have been implemented for decades as well as product and service development to meet governmental demands for risk monitoring and warning related to climate variability. However, there are few studies that describe, evaluate and analyze the operability of such systems. One of the highlights of this new research field is the level of participation and integration among actors involved in climate service definition and implementation. Emphasis has been placed on scientific knowledge production through collaborative networks - \"coproduction\" - in order to meet the different demands and needs of the various actors involved in climate service (social) construction. This perspective has been used in projects in Europe, such as EUPORIA (European Provision of Regional Impacts Assessments on Seasonal and Decadal Timescales) and ICAD (Informing Climate Adaptation Decisions), which focused on increasing the capacity of maximizing societal benefits through the use of new technology and knowledge associated with weather and climate forecasts and projections of climate change scenarios. This project aims to present and evaluate the state of the art of this new scientific discipline in Europe, while at the same time documenting the Brazilian experiences. It is expected that the project will allow the addition of new knowledge and perspective that can be used and applied to Brazilian research initiatives, such as that proposed by the international CLIMAX project, led by INPE and supported by FAPESP.

{"title":"High reliability and low-power chip clock design and optimization algorithms","abstract":"The on-chip clock is the key and core of integrated circuit design, affecting the performance and power consumption of the circuit. In high-performance chip designs, the on-chip clock design faces challenges such as increased frequency, process variations and manufacturability in the nano-era, and low power consumption. Traditional design methods and processes fail to meet new process and high-performance design requirements, resulting in iterative iterations and design convergence around clock design. This topic studies the clock node distribution planning method in the physical design stage, integrates the clock design into the layout design, and completes the distribution planning of the clock nodes. The subject first studies the layout algorithm oriented to the clock distribution. Under the condition of ensuring the traditional layout optimization goal, the physical distribution of the clock node is optimized according to the clock design requirements. On this basis, further consider the buffer\/gating unit planning and process changes in the clock design to improve the adaptability and robustness of the algorithm. With low power consumption, the position planning of the clock buffer\/gating unit is guided in the layout. At the same time, the factors affecting the variation of process parameters are introduced in the optimization, and the anti-interference design of the clock network is increased.

{"title":"Grb 10 Isoforms and Insulin Signaling","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The liver is an important target organ for gene therapy because it plays a central role in the metabolism and production of serum proteins. Nonviral vector plasmid DNA has been considered as the simplest and safest method to delivery gene to the liver. More recently, it has been demonstrated that plasmid DNA could be transfected to the liver by manually massaging the liver (MML). The method is non-invasive and does not induce any measurable toxicity in the treated animal. Furthermore, the level of gene expression is high enough to produce therapeutic effects in a diseased liver model. In this proposal, the mechanisms underlying the DNA transfer into hepatocytes by MML will be elucidated by answering specific questions: 1) Does MML induce a pressure that is critical for liver gene transfer? 2) Does MML transiently enlarge the fenestrae in the sinusoid endothelia cells of the liver allowing DNA to reach the hepatocytes? And 3) Is the plasmid DNA uptake by the liver an active, receptor-mediated and endocytosis processes? To increase gene transfer efficiency, a favorable non-viral vector for MML gene transfer will be developed, which will include the synthesis of a new carrier and construction of new plasmids. The design of this vector is based on an observation that gene transfer efficiency using MML could be further enhanced if the retention time and density of plasmid DNA in the liver are increased. The carrier will be PNA-PEG-Gal, in which peptide nucleic acid (PNA) will be conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and a target ligand, galactose (Gal), appended to the distal end of PEG. The PNA-PEG-galactose carrier is designed to carry plasmid DNA to hepatocytes through receptor-mediated binding mechanism. This strategy employs galactose moieties as homing devices for hepatocytes, and a PNA as a carrier to bind sequence-specifically to DNA. As a result, the retention time and density of plasmid DNA in the liver could be increased. The plasmids, containing either a luciferase reporter or hydroxylase (PAH) genes, with an Epstein Barr virus (EBV) element and multiple PNA-binding elements that have specific sequences for hybridization with PNA will also be constructed. The therapeutic effects on the metabolic disease, phenylketonuria (PKU), will be examined after the PAH gene transfer using the approach in this proposal.","for_first_level_name":"Technology","mesh_terms":["Animals","DNA","Galactose","Gene Transfer Techniques","Genetic Therapy","Genetic Vectors","Hepatocytes","Humans","Liver","Plasmids","Polyethylene Glycols","Transfection"]}
{"title":"Linear Microwave Attenuator","abstract":"For signal level control in microwave systems, attenuators are normally designed to improve logarithmic level variation (i.e. in dBs) in response to a control signal. For some level control applications, the logarithmic control is inadequate to provide the fine resolution needed at low attenuation levels. Examples of such requirements include: weighted loading of antenna arrays, alignment of mono-pulse receivers, antenna nulling, and digital modulation (e.g. QAM) for communications. In most of these applications, it is highly desirable to have independent means of control for amplitude and phase. This proposal describes several alternate circuit designs to attain the attenuation\/level control requirements, and outlines an approach to select the optimum design for MMIC implementation. Design options include: active gain controlled amplifiers vs. attenuators, and digital vs. analog control of attenuation\/gain. Methods of phase compensation and linearization, applicable to various design options, are also presented to show that the level control function can be accomplished with negligible phase variations. Hittite proposes to implement an MMIC design of the attenuator\/level control circuit. The MMIC design will lead to miniaturization and provide the flexibility of integrating additional microwave circuit functions on-chip with the attenuator. Hittite also proposes a laboratory demonstration of the selected approach using available assets.","for_first_level_name":"Technology","mesh_terms":["Equipment Design","Microwaves","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}

{"title":"ON-SITE GENERATION OF PHOSPHINE FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES","abstract":"PHOSPHINE (PH3) IS A GAS NECESSARY FOR MAKING COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS SUCH AS INP, INAS(1-X)PX, GAP, AND GAAS(1-X)PX AS WELL AS A DOPANT SOURCE FOR SILICON. IT IS A VERY TOXIC GAS WITH A TLV OF 0.3 PPM. NEW REGULATIONS MAKE THE TRANSPORT, STORAGE, AND HANDLING OF COMPRESSED GAS CYLINDERS OF PHOSPHINE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS, WE ARE DEVELOPING A COMPACT POINT OF USE PHOSPHINE GENERATOR. THE GENERATOR WILL PRODUCE SEMICONDUCTOR GRADE PHOSPHINE ON DEMAND AT THE SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION FACILITY. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL PROVIDE A MUCH SAFER SOURCE OF PHOSPHINE.","for_first_level_name":"Technology","mesh_terms":["Gases","Phosphines","Semiconductors","Silicon"]}

{"title":"Atomic scale information for the design of nanomaterials","abstract":"This project aims to develop a new tool to measure the 3-D distribution of atoms within nanoparticles. For the rational design of nanoparticles, it is necessary to compare the atomic scale structure to the resulting performance. But this information is hard to access. This projects aims to develop new methods so that atom probe microscopy can be applied to experimentally measure the precise 3-D location and identity of the individual atoms within nanoparticles, and apply them in the development of alloy catalyst nanoparticles that could make the sustainable production of liquid fuels from biomass commercially viable. These new tools would be useful across the wide range of engineering applications for which nanomaterials are currently being developed.","for_first_level_name":"Technology","mesh_terms":["Alloys","Catalysis","Nanoparticles"]}
